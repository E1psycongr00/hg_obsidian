The perimeter is 1+ 1+ 2 + 3 +5 = 12, We cannot have a polygon with either 12 or 50 25 the longest side because it 15 not possible to include 2 or more smaller sides that have a greater sum than either of them. It can be shown that the largest possible perimeter is 12.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng+kor"}
