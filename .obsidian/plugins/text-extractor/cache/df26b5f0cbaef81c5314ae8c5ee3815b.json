It can be covered comfortably in two semesters, maybe even with room to spare for special topics (AC circuits, numerical methods, plasma physics, transmission lines, antenna theory, etc.) A one-semester course could reasonably stop after Chapter 7. Unlike quantum mechanics or thermal physics (for example), there is a fairly general consensus with respect to the teaching of electrodynamics; the subjects to be included, and even their order of presentation, are not particularly controversial, and textbooks differ mainly in style and tone. My approach is perhaps less formal than most; I think this makes difficult ideas more interesting and accessible. For the third edition I have made a large number of small changes, in the interests of clarity and grace. I have also modified some notation to avoid inconsistencies or ambiguities. Thus the Cartesian unit vectors i, j, and k have been replaced with x, y, and z, so that all vectors are bold, and all unit vectors inherit the letter of the corresponding coordinate. (This also frees up k to be the propagation vector for electromagnetic waves.) It has always bothered me to use the same letter r for the spherical coordinate (distance from the origin) and the cylindrical coordinate (distance from the z axis). A common alternative for the latter is p, but that has more important business in electrodynamics, and after an exhaustive search I settled on the underemployed letter s; I hope this unorthodox usage will not be confusing. Some readers have urged me to abandon the script letter >i (the vector from a source point r' to the field point r) in favor of the more explicit r — r'. But this makes many equations distractingly cumbersome, especially when the unit vector i is involved. I know from my own teaching experience that unwary students are tempted to read >i as r—it certainly makes the integrals easier! I have inserted a section in Chapter 1 explaining this notation, and I hope that will help. If you are a student, please take note: -t = r — r', which is not the same as r. If you’re a teacher, please warn your students to pay close attention to the meaning of <4.. I think it’s good notation, but it does have to be handled with care. The main structural change is that I have removed the conservation laws and potentials from Chapter 7, creating two new short chapters (8 and 10). This should more smoothly accommodate one-semester courses, and it gives a tighter focus to Chapter 7. I have added some problems and examples (and removed a few that were not effective). And I have included more references to the accessible literature (particularly the American Journal of Physics). I realize, of course, that most readers will not have the time or inch- X PREFACE nation to consult these resources, but I think it is worthwhile anyway, if only to emphasize that electrodynamics, notwithstanding its venerable age, is very much alive, and intriguing new discoveries are being made all the time. I hope that occasionally a problem will pique your curiosity, and you will be inspired to look up the reference—some of them are real gems. As in the previous editions, I distinguish two kinds of problems. Some have a specific pedagogical purpose, and should be worked immediately after reading the section to which they pertain; these I have placed at the pertinent point within the chapter. (In a few cases the solution to a problem is used later in the text; these are indicated by a bullet (•) in the left margin.) Longer problems, or those of a more general nature, will be found at the end of each chapter. When I teach the subject I assign some of these, and work a few of them in class. Unusually challenging problems are flagged by an exclamation point (!) in the margin. Many readers have asked that the answers to problems be provided at the back of the book; unfortunately, just as many are strenuously opposed. I have compromised, supplying answers when this seems particularly appropriate. A complete solution manual is available (to instructors) from the publisher. I have benefitted from the comments of many colleagues—I cannot list them all here. But I would like to thank the following people for suggestions that contributed specifically to the third edition: Burton Brody (Bard), Steven Grimes (Ohio), Mark Heald (Swarth- more), Jim McTavish (Liverpool), Matthew Moelter (Puget Sound), Paul Nachman (New Mexico State), Gigi Quartapelle (Milan), Carl A. Rotter (West Virginia), Daniel Schroeder (Weber State), Juri Silmberg (Ryerson Polytechnic), Walther N. Spjeldvik (Weber State), Larry Tankersley (Naval Academy), and Dudley Towne (Amherst). Practically everything I know about electrodynamics—certainly about teaching electrodynamics—I owe to Edward Purcell. David J. Griffiths Advertisement What is electrodynamics, and how does it fit into the general scheme of physics? Four Realms of Mechanics In the diagram below I have sketched out the four great realms of mechanics: Classical Mechanics (Newton) Quantum Mechanics (Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, et al.) Special Relativity (Einstein) Quantum Field Theory (Dirac, Pauli, Feynman, Schwinger, et al.) Newtonian mechanics was found to be inadequate in the early years of this century—it’s all right in “everyday life,” but for objects moving at high speeds (near the speed of light) it is incorrect, and must be replaced by special relativity (introduced by Einstein in 1905); for objects that are extremely small (near the size of atoms) it fails for different reasons, and is superseded by quantum mechanics (developed by Bohr, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, and many others, in the twenties, mostly). For objects that are both very fast and very small (as is common in modem particle physics), a mechanics that combines relativity and quantum principles is in order: this relativistic quantum mechanics is known as quantum field theory—it was worked out in the thirties and forties, but even today it cannot claim to be a completely satisfactory system. In this book, save for the last chapter, we shall work exclusively in the domain of classical mechanics, although electrodynamics extends with unique simplicity to the other three realms. (In fact, the theory is in most respects automatically consistent with special relativity, for which it was, historically, the main stimulus.) xi ADVERTISEMENT xii Four Kinds of Forces Mechanics tells us how a system will behave when subjected to a given force. There are just four basic forces known (presently) to physics: I list them in the order of decreasing strength: 1. Strong 2. Electromagnetic 3. Weak 4. Gravitational The brevity of this list may surprise you. Where is friction? Where is the “normal” force that keeps you from falling through the floor? Where are the chemical forces that bind molecules together? Where is the force of impact between two colliding billiard balls? The answer is that all these forces are electromagnetic. Indeed, it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that we live in an electromagnetic world—for virtually every force we experience in everyday life, with the exception of gravity, is electromagnetic in origin. The strong forces, which hold protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus, have extremely short range, so we do not “feel” them, in spite of the fact that they are a hundred times more powerful than electrical forces. The weak forces, which account for certain kinds of radioactive decay, are not only of short range; they are far weaker than electromagnetic ones to begin with. As for gravity, it is so pitifully feeble (compared to all of the others) that it is only by virtue of huge mass concentrations (like the earth and the sun) that we ever notice it at all. The electrical repulsion between two electrons is 1042 times as large as their gravitational attraction, and if atoms were held together by gravitational (instead of electrical) forces, a single hydrogen atom would be much larger than the known universe. Not only are electromagnetic forces overwhelmingly the dominant ones in everyday life, they are also, at present, the only ones that are completely understood. There is, of course, a classical theory of gravity (Newton’s law of universal gravitation) and a relativistic one (Einstein’s general relativity), but no entirely satisfactory quantum mechanical theory of gravity has been constructed (though many people are working on it). At the present time there is a very successful (if cumbersome) theory for the weak interactions, and a strikingly attractive candidate (called chromodynamics) for the strong interactions. All these theories draw their inspiration from electrodynamics; none can claim conclusive experimental verification at this stage. So electrodynamics, a beautifully complete and successful theory, has become a kind of paradigm for physicists: an ideal model that other theories strive to emulate. The laws of classical electrodynamics were discovered in bits and pieces by Franklin, Coulomb, Ampere, Faraday, and others, but the person who completed the job, and packaged it all in the compact and consistent form it has today, was James Clerk Maxwell. The theory is now a little over a hundred years old. The Unification of Physical Theories In the beginning, electricity and magnetism were entirely separate subjects. The one dealt with glass rods and cat’s fur, pith balls, batteries, currents, electrolysis, and lightning; the other with bar magnets, iron filings, compass needles, and the North Pole. But in 1820 Oersted noticed that an electric current could deflect a magnetic compass needle. Soon afterward, Ampere correctly postulated that all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in motion. Then, in 1831, Faraday discovered that a moving magnet generates an electric current. By the time Maxwell and Lorentz put the finishing touches on the theory, electricity and magnetism were inextricably intertwined. They could no longer be regarded as separate subjects, but rather as two aspects of a single subject: electromagnetism. Faraday had speculated that light, too, is electrical in nature. Maxwell’s theory provided spectacular justification for this hypothesis, and soon optics—the study of lenses, mirrors, prisms, interference, and diffraction—was incorporated into electromagnetism. Hertz, who presented the decisive experimental confirmation for Maxwell’s theory in 1888, put it this way: “The connection between light and electricity is now established ... In every flame, in every luminous particle, we see an electrical process ... Thus, the domain of electricity extends over the whole of nature. It even affects ourselves intimately: we perceive that we possess ... an electrical organ—the eye.” By 1900, then, three great branches of physics, electricity, magnetism, and optics, had merged into a single unified theory. (And it was soon apparent that visible light represents only a tiny “window” in the vast spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, from radio though microwaves, infrared and ultraviolet, to x- rays and gamma rays.) Einstein dreamed of a further unification, which would combine gravity and electrody¬ namics, in much the same way as electricity and magnetism had been combined a century earlier. His unified field theory was not particularly successful, but in recent years the same impulse has spawned a hierarchy of increasingly ambitious (and speculative) unification schemes, beginning in the 1960s with the electroweak theory of Glashow, Weinberg, and Salam (which joins the weak and electromagnetic forces), and culminating in the 1980s with the superstring theory (which, according to its proponents, incorporates all four forces in a single “theory of everything”). At each step in this hierarchy the mathematical difficulties mount, and the gap between inspired conjecture and experimental test widens; nevertheless, it is clear that the unification of forces initiated by electrodynamics has become a major theme in the progress of physics. The Field Formulation of Electrodynamics The fundamental problem a theory of electromagnetism hopes to solve is this: I hold up a bunch of electric charges here (and maybe shake them around)—what happens to some other charge, over there? The classical solution takes the form of a field theory: We say that the space around an electric charge is permeated by electric and magnetic fields (the electromagnetic “odor,” as it were, of the charge). A second charge, in the presence of these fields, experiences a force; the fields, then, transmit the influence from one charge to the other—they mediate the interaction. XIV ADVERTISEMENT When a charge undergoes acceleration, a portion of the field “detaches” itself, in a sense, and travels off at the speed of light, carrying with it energy, momentum, and angular momentum. We call this electromagnetic radiation. Its existence invites (if not compels) us to regard the fields as independent dynamical entities in their own right, every bit as “real” as atoms or baseballs. Our interest accordingly shifts from the study of forces between charges to the theory of the fields themselves. But it takes a charge to produce an electromagnetic field, and it takes another charge to detect one, so we had best begin by reviewing the essential properties of electric charge. Electric Charge 1. Charge comes in two varieties, which we call “plus” and “minus,” because their effects tend to cancel (if you have +q and -q at the same point, electrically it is the same as having no charge there at all). This may seem too obvious to warrant comment, but I encourage you to contemplate other possibilities: what if there were 8 or 10 different species of charge? (In chromodynamics there are, in fact, three quantities analogous to electric charge, each of which may be positive or negative.) Or what if the two kinds did not tend to cancel? The extraordinary fact is that plus and minus charges occur in exactly equal amounts, to fantastic precision, in bulk matter, so that their effects are almost completely neutralized. Were it not for this, we would be subjected to enormous forces: a potato would explode violently if the cancellation were imperfect by as little as one part in 1010. 2. Charge is conserved: it cannot be created or destroyed—what there is now has always been. (A plus charge can “annihilate” an equal minus charge, but a plus charge cannot simply disappear by itself— something must account for that electric charge.) So the total charge of the universe is fixed for all time. This is called global conservation of charge. Actually, I can say something much stronger: Global conservation would allow for a charge to disappear in New York and instantly reappear in San Francisco (that wouldn’t affect the total), and yet we know this doesn’t happen. If the charge was in New York and it went to San Francisco, then it must have passed along some continuous path from one to the other. This is called local conservation of charge. Later on we’ll see how to formulate a precise mathematical law expressing local conservation of charge—it’s called the continuity equation. 3. Charge is quantized. Although nothing in classical electrodynamics requires that it be so, the fact is that electric charge comes only in discrete lumps—integer multiples of the basic unit of charge. If we call the charge on the proton +c, then the electron carries charge -e, the neutron charge zero, the pi mesons +e, 0, and -e, the carbon nucleus +6e, and so on (never 7.392c, or even 1 /2c).1 This fundamental unit of charge is extremely small, so for practical purposes it is usually appropriate to ignore quantization altogether. Water, too, “really” consists of discrete lumps (molecules); yet, if we are dealing with reasonably large large quantities of it we can treat it as a continuous fluid. This is in fact much closer to Maxwell’s own view; he knew nothing of electrons and protons—he must have pictured 1 Actually, protons and neutrons are composed of three quarks, which carry fractional charges (± | e and ± j e). However, free quarks do not appear to exist in nature, and in any event this does not alter the fact that charge is quantized; it merely reduces the size of the basic unit. XV charge as a kind of “jelly” that could be divided up into portions of any size and smeared out at will. These, then, are the basic properties of charge. Before we discuss the forces between charges, some mathematical tools are necessary; their introduction will occupy us in Chap¬ ter 1. Units The subject of electrodynamics is plagued by competing systems of units, which sometimes render it difficult for physicists to communicate with one another. The problem is far worse than in mechanics, where Neanderthals still speak of pounds and feet; for in mechanics at least all equations look the same, regardless of the units used to measure quantities. Newton’s second law remains F = ma, whether it is feet-pounds-seconds, kilograms- meters-seconds, or whatever. But this is not so in electromagnetism, where Coulomb’s law may appear variously as —r— n. (Gaussian), or n-1 1 <7l<72- - 47reo 't 2 (SI), or 1 4jv n?- (HL). Of the systems in common use, the two most popular are Gaussian (cgs) and S»I (mks). Ele¬ mentary particle theorists favor yet a third system: Heaviside-Lorentz. Although Gaussian units offer distinct theoretical advantages, most undergraduate instructors seen! to prefer SI, I suppose because they incorporate the familiar household units (volts, amperes, and watts). In this book, therefore, I have used SI units. Appendix C provides a “dictionary” for converting the main results irlto Gaussian units. Chapter 1 Vector Analysis 1.1 Vector Algebra 1.1.1 Vector Operations If you walk 4 miles due north and then 3 miles due east (Fig. 1.1), you will have gone a total of 7 miles, but you’re not 7 miles from where you set out—you’re only 5. We need an arithmetic to describe quantities like this, which evidently do not add in the ordinary way. The reason they don’t, of course, is that displacements (straight line segments going from one point to another) have direction as well as magnitude (length), and it is essential to take both into account when you combine them. Such objects are called vectors: velocity, acceleration, force and momentum are other examples. By contrast, quantities that have magnitude but no direction are called scalars: examples include mass, charge, density, and temperature. I shall use boldface (A, B, and so on) for vectors and ordinary type for scalars. The magnitude of a vector A is written |Aj or, more simply, A. In diagrams, vectors are denoted by arrows: the length of the arrow is proportional to the magnitude of the vector, and the arrowhead indicates its direction. Minus A (—A) is a vector with the 2 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS same magnitude as A but of opposite direction (Fig. 1.2). Note that vectors have magnitude and direction but not location: a displacement of 4 miles due north from Washington is represented by the same vector as a displacement 4 miles north from Baltimore (neglecting, of course, the curvature of the earth). On a diagram, therefore, you can slide the arrow around at will, as long &s you don’t change its length or direction. We define four vector operations: addition and three kinds of multiplication. (i) Addition of two vectors. Place the tail of B at the head of A; the sum, A + B, is the vector from the tail of A to the head of B (Fig. 1. 3). (This rule generalizes the obvious procedure for combining two displacements.) Addition is commutative: A + B = B + A; 3 miles east followed by 4 miles north gets you to the same place as 4 miles north followed by 3 miles east. Addition is also associative: (A + B) + C = A + (B + C). To subtract a vector (Fig. 1.4), add its opposite: A - B = A + (-B). Figure 1.3 (ii) Multiplication by a scalar. Multiplication of a vector by a positive scalar a mul¬ tiplies the magnitude but leaves the direction unchanged (Fig. 1.5). (If a is negative, the direction is reversed.) Scalar multiplication is distributive: a( A + B) = aA + aB. (iii) Dot product of two vectors. The dot product of two vectors is defined by A B = AB cosF, (1.1) where 6 is the angle they form when placed tail-to-tail (Fig. 1.6). Note that A B is itself a scalar (hence the alternative name scalar product). The dot product is commutative, A B = B A, 7.7. VECTOR ALGEBRA 3 A Figure 1.5 and distributive, A • (B + C) = A   B + A • C. (1.2) Geometrically, A • B is the product of A times the projection of B along A (or the product of B times the projection of A along B). If the two vectors are parallel, then A • B = A B. In particular, for any vector A, A   A = A2. (1.3) If A and B are perpendicular, then A   B = 0. Example 1.1 Let C = A — B (Fig. 1.7), and calculate the dot product of C with itself. Solution: CC = (A-B)(A-B)=AA — AB-BA + BB, or C2 = A2 + B2 - 2A B cost?. This is the law of cosines. (iv) Cross product of two vectors. The cross product of two vectors is defined by A x B = Afisin#n, (1.4) where n is a unit vector (vector of length 1) pointing perpendicular to the plane of A and B. (I shall use a hat O to designate unit vectors.) Of course, there are two directions perpendicular to any plane: “in” and “out.” The ambiguity is resolved by the right-hand rule: let your fingers point in the direction of the first vector and curl around (via the smaller angle) toward the second; then your thumb indicates the direction of n. (In Fig. 1.8 A x B points into the page; B x A points out of the page.) Note that A x B is itself a vector (hence the alternative name vector product). The cross product is distributive, A x (B + C) = (A x B) + (A x C), (1.5) 4 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS T / / / A / / / / A0 \\ / B B Figure 1.7 Figure 1.8 but not commutative. In fact, (B x A) = — (A x B). (1.6) Geometrically, |A x B| is the area of the parallelogram generated by A and B (Fig. 1.8). If two vectors are parallel, their cross product is zero. In particular, for any vector A. A x A = 0 Problem 1.1 Using the definitions in Eqs. 1.1 and 1.4, and appropriate diagrams, show that the dot product and cross product are distributive, a) when the three vectors are coplanar; b) in the general case. Problem 1.2 Is the cross product associative? (A x B) x C = A x (B x C). If so, prove it; if not, provide a counterexample. 1.1.2 Vector Algebra: Component Form In the previous section I defined the four vector operations (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product) in “abstract” form—that is, without reference to any partic¬ ular coordinate system. In practice, it is often easier to set up Cartesian coordinates x, y, z and work with vector “components.” Let x, y, and z be unit vectors parallel to the x, y, and z axes, respectively (Fig. 1.9(a)). An arbitrary vector A can be expanded in terms of these basis vectors (Fig. 1.9(b)): A = Axx + Ay y + Azz. 1.1. VECTOR ALGEBRA 5 Figure 1.9 The numbers Ax, Ay, and Az, are called components of A; geometrically, they are the projections of A along the three coordinate axes. We can now reformulate each of the four vector operations as a rule for manipulating components: A + B = (A*x + Ayy + Az z) + (B xx. + By y + Bzz) = (Ax + Bx)x + {Ay + By)y + {Az + Bz) z. (1.7) (i) Rule: To add vectors, add like components. aA = (aAx)x+(aA y)y + (aAz)z. (1.8) (ii) Rule: To multiply by a scalar, multiply each component. Because x, y, and z are mutually perpendicular unit vectors, x-x = y-y = z-z=l; x-y = x-z = y-z = 0. (1.9) Accordingly, A B = (AxX + Avy + Azz) • (Bxx + Byy + Bzz) = AXB X + AyB y + AZB Z. (1.10) (iii) Rule: To calculate the dot product, multiply like components, and add. In particular, A   A = A2X + A2y + A2Z, so A = y/A2x+ Ay + A2. (1.11) (This is, if you like, the three-dimensional generalization of the Pythagorean theorem.) Note that the dot product of A with any unit vector is the component of A along that direction (thus A • x = Ax, A   y = Ay, and A • z = Az). 6 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS Similarly,1 Therefore, x x x = yxy x x y = — y x x y x z = — z x y Z X X = —X X z = z x z = 0, = z, = X, = y. (1.12) A x B = (Axx + Ayy + Azi) x (Bxx + By y + Bzi) (1.13) = (AyB z - AzB y)x + (AZB X - AXB Z)y + (AxB y - AyB x)z. This cumbersome expression can be written more neatly as a determinant: A x B = x y z Ay Ay Az Bx By Bz (1.14) (iv) Rule: To calculate the cross product, form, the determinant whose first row is x, y, z, whose second row is A (in component form), and whose third row is B. Example 1.2 Find the angle between the face diagonals of a cube. Solution: We might as well use a cube of side 1, and place it as shown in Fig. 1.10, with one corner at the origin. The face diagonals A and B are A = lx + 0y+lz; B = Ox + 1 y + 1 z. Figure 1.10 'These signs pertain to a right-handed coordinate system (x-axis out of the page, y-axis to the right, z-axis up, or any rotated version thereof). In a left-handed system (z-axis down) the signs are reversed: x x y = —z, and so on. We shall use right-handed systems exclusively. 1.1. VECTOR ALGEBRA 7 So, in component form, A-B = 1 - 0 + 0- 1 + 1   1 = 1. On the other hand, in “abstract” form, A • B = AB cos 9 = \\fl\\fl cos 9 = 2 cos 9. Therefore, cos# = 1/2, or #=60°. Of course, you can get the answer more easily by drawing in a diagonal across the top of the cube, completing the equilateral triangle. But in cases where the geometry is not so simple, this device of comparing the abstract and compohent forms of the dot product can be a very efficient means of finding angles. Problem 1.3 Find the angle between the body diagonals of a cube. Problem 1.4 Use the cross product to find the cdmponents of the unit vector n perpendicular to the plane shown in Fig. 1.11. 1.1.3 Triple Products Since the cross product of two vectors is itself a vector, it can be dotted or crossed with a third vector to form a triple product. (i) Scalar triple product: A • (B x C). Geometrically, |A • (B x C)| is the volume of the parallelepiped generated by A, B, and C, since |B x C| is the area of the base, and A cos # is the altitude (Fig. 1.12). Evidently, A-( B x C) = B • (C x A) = C-(A x B), (1.15) for they all correspond to the same figure. Note that “alphabetical” order is preserved—in view of Eq. 1.6, the “nonalphabetical” triple products, A • (C x B) = B • (A x C) = C • (B x A), Figure 1.11 Figure 1.12 8 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS have the opposite sign. In component form, A • (B x C) = Ax Ay Az Bx By Bz CX Cy C- Note that the dot and cross can be interchanged: A • (B x C) = (A x B) • C (1.16) (this follows immediately from Eq. 1.15); however, the placement of the parentheses is critical: (A • B) x C is a meaningless expression—you can’t make a cross product from a scalar and a vector. (ii) Vector triple product: A x (B x C). The vector triple product can be simplified by the so-called BAC-CAB rule: A x (B x C) = B(A • C) — C(A • B). (1.17) Notice that (A x B) x C = -C x (A x B) = -A(B • C) + B(A • C) is an entirely different vector. Incidentally, all higher vector products can be similarly reduced, often by repeated application of Eq. 1.17, so it is never necessary for an expression to contain more than one cross product in any term. For instance, (AxB)-(CxD) = (A • C)(B • D) — (A • D)(B • C); A x (B x (C x D)) = B(A • (C x D)) - (A   B)(C x D). (1.18) Problem 1.5 Prove the BAC-CAB rule by writing out both sides in component form. Problem 1.6 Prove that [A x (B x C)] + [B x (C x A)] + [C x (A x B)] = 0. Under what conditions does A x (B x C) = (A x B) x C? 1.1.4 Position, Displacement, and Separation Vectors The location of a point in three dimensions can be described by listing its Cartesian coor¬ dinates (x, y, z). The vector to that point from the origin (Fig. 1.13) is called the position vector: r = xx + yy + zz. (1.19) VECTOR ALGEBRA 9 1.1. source point field point I will reserve the letter r for this purpose, throughout the book. Its magnitude, r is the distance from the origin, and r = is a unit vector pointing radially outward. The infinitesimal displacement vector, from (x, y, z) to (x + dx,y + dy, z +dz), is dl = dxx + dyy + dzi. (1-22) (We could call this dr, since that’s what it is, but it is useful to reserve a special letter for infinitesimal displacements.) In electrodynamics one frequently encounters problems involving two points—typically, a source point, r', where an electric charge is located, and a field point, r, at which you are calculating the electric or magnetic field (Fig. 1.14). It pays to adopt right from the start some short-hand notation for the separation vector from the source point to the field point. I shall use for this purpose the script letter 4: — - lx2 + y2 + z2, r _ x x + y y + z i r jx 2 + y2 + Z2 (1.20) (1.21) 4 = r - r . (1.23) Its magnitude is 4= |r-r'|, (1.24) and a unit vector in the direction from r' to r is n. n. r — V1 r' 7r (1.25) 10 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS In Cartesian coordinates, *=(•*- x')x + (y - y')y + (z - z')z, (1.26) 4 = y/(x - x')2 + (y- y')2 + (z - z')2, (1.27) (x - x')x + (y - y')y + (Z - z')z /L = --- (1.28) y/(x - x')2 + (y- yr)2 + (z- z')2 (from which you can begjn to appreciate the advantage of the scripts notation). Problem 1.7 Find the separation vector-4 from the source point (2,8,7) to the field point (4,6,8). Determine its magnitude (4), and construct the unit vector i. 1.1.5 How Vectors Transform The definition of a vector as “a quantity with a magnitude and direction” is not altogether satisfactory: What precisely does “direction” mean?2 This may seem a pedantic question, but we shall shortly encounter a species of derivative that looks rather like a vector, and we’ll want to know for sure whether it is one. You might be inclined to say that a vector is anything that has three components that combine properly under addition. Well, how about this: We have a barrel of fruit that contains N x pears, N y apples, and N z bananas. Is N = N xx + iVvy + N zz a vector? It has three components, and when you add another barrel with Mx pears, My apples, and Mz bananas the result is (N x + Mx) pears, (N y + My) apples, (N z + M:) bananas. So it does add like a vector. Yet it’s obviously not a vector, in the physicist’s sense of the word, because it doesn’t really have a direction. What exactly is wrong with it? The answer is that N does not transform properly when you change coordinates. The coordinate frame we use to describe positions in space is of course entirely arbitrary, but there is a specific geometrical transformation law for converting vector components from one frame to another. Suppose, for instance, the x, y, z. system is rotated by angle <p, relative to v, y, z, about the common x = x axes. From Fig. 1.15, Ay = A cost?, Az = A sinO, while Ay = A cos 9 — A cos(6 — cp) = A (cos 0 cos <p + sin0 sin <p) = cos 4> Ay + sin (pAz, Az = A sin 0 = A sin(0 — (p) = A (sin 0 cos (p — cos 0 sin f) = — sin f Ay + cos <pAz. 2This section can be skipped without loss of continuity. 1.1. VECTOR ALGEBRA 11 Figure 1.15 We might express this conclusion in matrix notation: ( Ay\\/ cos4> sinf \\ ( A y\\ \\A ZJ \\-sin <j> cos 4>J\\A ZJ - More generally, for rotation about an arbitrary axis in three dimensions, the transfor¬ mation law takes the form / ^_x \\ / Rxx Rxy Rxz \\ / \\ I I = I Ry* Ryy ^yz II Av ) > (1.30) V Az J \\ Rzx Rzy Rzz J y Az J or, more compactly, 3 A, =Y2 R uAn (1.31) j=i where the index 1 stands for x, 2 for y, and 3 for z. The elements of the matrix R can be ascertained, for a given rotation, by the same sort of geometrical arguments as we used for a rotation about the x axis. Now: Do the components of N transform in this way? Of course not—it doesn’t matter what coordinates you use to represent positions in space, there is still the same number of apples in the barrel. You can’t^onvert a pear into a banana by choosing a different set of axes, but you can turn Ax into Ay. Formally, then, a vector is any set of three components that transforms in the same manner as a displacement when you change coordinates. As always, displacement is the model for the behavior of all vectors. By the way, a (second-rank) tensor is a quantity with nine components, Txx, Txy, Txz, Tvx,, Tzz. which transforms with two factors of R: T xx = Rxx{RxxTxx + Rxy Txy + RXZT XZ) ~\\~Rxy(RxxTyX + RxyTyy + RxzT yz) +Rxz(RxxTzx + RxyT zy + RXzTzz),  . . 12 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS or, more compactly, 3 3 Tu = Y.Y.r *r »t u- k= 1 /=! (1.32) In general, an nth-rank tensor has n indices and 3\" components, and transforms with n factors of R. In this hierarchy, a vector is a tensor of rank 1, and a scalar is a tensor of rank zero. Problem 1.8 (a) Prove that_the two-dimensional rotation matrix (1.29) preserves dot products. (That is, show that AyBy + AZ~BZ = AyB y + AZB Z.) (b) What constraints must the elements (Rjj) of the three-dimensional rotation matrix (1.30) satisfy in order to preserve the length of A (for all vectors A)? Problem 1.9 Find the transformation matrix R that describes a rotation by 120° about an axis from the origin through the point (1,1,1). The rotation is clockwise as you look down the axis toward the origin. Problem 1.10 (a) How do the components of a vector transform under a translation of coordinates (x = x, y = y — a,z = z., Fig. 1.16a)? (b) How do the components of a vector transform under an inversion of coordinates Qc = -x, y = —y, z = -z, Fig. 1.16b)? (c) How does the cross product (1.13) of two vectors transform under inversion? [The cross- product of two vectors is properly called a pseudovector because of this “anomalous” be¬ havior.] Is the cross product of two pseudovectors a vector, or a pseudovector? Name two pseudovector quantities in classical mechanics. (d) How does the scalar triple product of three vectors transform under inversions? (Such an object is called a pseudoscalar.) Figure 1.16 1.2. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 13 1.2 Differential Calculus 1.2.1 “Ordinary” Derivatives Question: Suppose we have a function of one variable: f(x). What does the derivative, df/dx, do for us? Answer: It tells us how rapidly the function f(x) varies when we change the argument x by a tiny amount, dx: df = {%)dx~ ,U3> In words: If we change x by an amount dx, then / changes by an amount df: the derivative is the proportionality factor. For example, in Fig. 1.17(a), the function varies slowly with v, and the derivative is correspondingly small. In Fig. 1.17(b), / increases rapidly with x, and the derivative is large, as you move away from x = 0. Geometrical Interpretation: The derivative df/dx is the slope of the graph of / versus x. f (a) Figure 1.17 1.2.2 Gradient Suppose, now, that we have a function of three variables—say, the temperature T(x, y, z) in a room. (Start out in one comer, and set up a system of axes; then for each point (x, y, z) in the room, T gives the temperature at that spot.) We want to generalize the notion of “derivative” to functions like T, which depend not on one but on three variables. Now a derivative is supposed to tell us how fast the function varies, if we move a little distance. But this time the situation is more complicated, because it depends on what direction we move: If we go straight up, then the temperature will probably increase fairly rapidly, but if we move horizontally, it may not change much at all. In fact, the question “How fast does T vary?” has an infinite number of answers, one for each direction we might choose to explore. Fortunately, the problem is not as bad as it looks. A theorem on partial derivatives states that ) dx + dT dy dy + dT 3 z dz- dT = dT dx (1.34) 14 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS This tells us how T changes when we alter all three variables by the infinitesimal amounts dx, dy, dz. Notice that we do not require an infinite number of derivatives— three will suffice: the partial derivatives along each of the three coordinate directions. Equation 1.34 is reminiscent of a dot product: dT (dT „ 9T„ dT f —x H-y H-z \\ dx dyj dz (VT)   (dl), (dx x + dy y + dzz) (1.35) where 9T„ dT„ dT„ VT = —xH-yH-z dx dy dz (1.36) is the gradient of T. VT is a vector quantity, with three components; it is the generalized derivative we have been looking for. Equation 1.35 is the three-dimensional version of Eq. 1.33. Geometrical Interpretation of the Gradient: Like any vector, the gradient has magnitude and direction. To determine its geometrical meaning, let’s rewrite the dot product (1.35) in abstract form: dT = VT  d \\=\\VT\\\\d\\\\cos6, (1.37) where 6 is the angle between VT and dl. Now, if we fix the magnitude \\d\\\\ and search around in various directions (that is, vary 6), the maximum change in T evidentally occurs when 6=0 (for then cosd = 1). That is, for a fixed distance \\d\\\\, dT is greatest when I move in the same direction as VT. Thus: The gradient VT points in the direction of maximum increase of the function T. Moreover: The magnitude |VT| gives the slope (rate of increase) along this maximal direction. Imagine you are standing on a hillside. Look all around you, and find the direction of steepest ascent. That is the direction of the gradient. Now measure the slope in that direction (rise over run). That is the magnitude of the gradient. (Here the function we’re talking about is the height of the hill, and the coordinates it depends on are positions— latitude and longitude, say. This function depends on only two variables, not three, but the geometrical meaning of the gradient is easier to grasp in two dimensions.) Notice from Eq. 1.37 that the direction of maximum descent is opposite to the direction of maximum ascent, while at right angles (6 = 90°) the slope is zero (the gradient is perpendicular to the contour lines). You can conceive of surfaces that do not have these properties, but they always have “kinks” in them and correspond to nondifferentiable functions. What would it mean for the gradient to vanish? If VT = 0 at (x, y, z), then dT = 0 for small displacements about the point (x, y,z). This is, then, a stationary point of the function T(x, y, z). It could be a maximum (a summit), a minimum (a valley), a saddle 1.2. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 15 point (a pass), or a “shoulder.” This is analogous to the situation for functions of one variable, where a vanishing derivative signals a maximum, a minimum, or an inflection. In particular, if you want to locate the extrema of a function of three variables, set its gradient equal to zero. Example 1.3 Find the gradient of r = + y2 + z2 (the magnitude of the position vector). Solution; Vr = dr dr dr „ • x H— y H-z dx dy d z 1 2x :X + 1 2y 1 y + z- 2z 2 y/x2+ y 2 + z2 2^ 2+ y 2 + Z2 2v /* 2 + v2 + Z2 XX + yy + ZZ _ r _ „ Vx2 + y2 + z2 r Does this make sense? Well, it says that the distance from the origin increases most rapidly in the radial direction, and that its rate of increase in that direction is 1.. .just what you’d expect. Problem 1.11 Find the gradients of the following functions: (a) /(•*, y, z) = x2 + y3 + z4. (b) f(x, y, z) = x2y 2z 4. (c) f{x, y, z) = ex sin(y) ln(z). Problem 1.12 The height of a certain hill (in feet) is given by h(x, y) = 10(2xy - 3x2 - 4y 2 - 18x + 28y + 12), where y is the distance (in miles) north, x the distance east of South Hadley. (a) Where is the top of the hill located? (b) How high is the hill? (c) How steep is the slope (in feet per mile) at a point 1 mile north and one mile east of South Hadley? In what direction is the slope steepest, at that point? Problem 1.13 Let 4 be the separation vector from a fixed point (a ', v', to the point (a. y, z), and let n, be its length. Show that (a) V(42) =2*. (b) V(l/4) = -hN 1. (c) What is the general formula for V (-! ”) ? 16 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS Problem 1.14 Suppose that / is a function of two variables (y and z) only. Show that the gradient V/ = (3//3y)y + (3//3z)z transforms as a vector under rotations. Eq. 1.29. [Hint: (df/dy) = (3//3y)(3y/3y) + (df/dz)(dz/dy), and the analogous formula for df/dz. We know that y = y cos <p + z sin <p and z = -y sin <p + z cos 0; “solve” these equations for y and z (as functions of y and z), and compute the needed derivatives dy/dy, dz/dy, etc.] 1.2.3 The Operator V The gradient has the formal appearance of a vector, V, “multiplying” a scalar T: VT 3 „ 3 „ 3 . _ x- 1- y- 1- z— T. dx Jd y 3 z/ (1.38) (For once 1 write the unit vectors to the left, just so no one will think this means dx/dx, and so on—which would be zero, since x is constant.) The term in parentheses is called “del”: „ 3 V =x— „ 3 + y— „ 3 + ZT ~- dx dy 3 z (1.39) Of course, del is not a vector, in the usual sense. Indeed, it is without specific meaning until we provide it with a function to act upon. Furthermore, it does not “multiply” T; rather, it is an instruction to differentiate what follows. To be precise, then, we should say that V is a vector operator that acts upon T, not a vector that multiplies T. With this qualification, though, V mimics the behavior of an ordinary vector in virtually every way; almost anything that can be done with other vectors can also be done with V, if we merely translate “multiply” by “act upon.” So by all means take the vector appearance of V seriously: it is a marvelous piece of notational simplification, as you will appreciate if you ever consult Maxwell’s original work on electromagnetism, written without the benefit of V. Now an ordinary vector A can multiply in three ways: 1. Multiply a scalar a : A a; 2. Multiply another vector B, via the dot product: A • B; 3. Multiply another vector via the cross product: A x B. Correspondingly, there are three ways the operator V can act: 1. On a scalar function T : VT (the gradient); 2. On a vector function v, via the dot product: V • v (the divergence); 3. On a vector function v, via the cross product: V x v (the curl). We have already discussed the gradient. In the following sections we examine the other two vector derivatives: divergence and curl. 1.2. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 17 1.2.4 The Divergence From the definition of V we construct the divergence: V v 3 ,3 ,3 dvx dvy dv7 - -J— - —j— 3x 3y dz (vxx + vyy + vzi) (1.40) Observe that the divergence of a vector function v is itself a scalar V • v. (You can’t have the divergence of a scalar: that’s meaningless.) Geometrical Interpretation: The name divergence is well chosen, for V • v is a measure of how much the vector v spreads out (diverges) from the point in question. For example, the vector function in Fig. 1.18a has a large (positive) divergence (if the arrows pointed in, it would be a large negative divergence), the function in Fig. 1.18b has zero divergence, and the function in Fig. 1.18c again has a positive divergence. (Please understand that v here is & function—there’s a different vector associated with every point in space. In the diagrams, 4 (a) (b) t t t t t t t (c) Figure 1.18 18 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS of course, I can only draw the arrows at a few representative locations.) Imagine standing at the edge of a pond. Sprinkle some sawdust or pine needles on the surface. If the material spreads out, then you dropped it at a point of positive divergence; if it collects together, you dropped it at a point of negative divergence. (The vector function v in this model is the velocity of the water—this is a two-dimensional example, but it helps give one a “feel” for what the divergence means. A point of positive divergence is a source, or “faucet”; a point of negative divergence is a sink, or “drain.”) Example 1.4 Suppose the functions in Fig. 1.18 arc v„ = r = xx + yy + zz, v/, = z, and vc = zz. Calculate their divergences. Solution: 9 9 9 V • va = — (*) + —00 + — (z) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. 9x 9y oz As anticipated, this function has a positive divergence. v   yh = ^(0) + ^-(0) + |-(1) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, ox 9y oz as expected. 9 9 9 v   vc = — (0) + — (0) + — (z) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1. ox oy dz Problem 1.15 Calculate the divergence of the following vector functions: (a) ya = x2 x + 3xz2 y — 2xz z. (b) \\ h = xyx + 2yz y + 3zv z. (c) vc = y2 x + (2xy + z2) y + 2>>z z. Problem 1.16 Sketch the vector function r V=^ ’ and compute its divergence. The answer may surprise you... can you explain it? Problem 1.17 In two dimensions, show that the divergence transforms as a scalar under rota¬ tions. [Hint: Use Eq. 1.29 to determine 1+ and +-. and the method of Prob. 1.14 to calculate the derivatives. Your aim is to show that dTiy/dy + dvz/ dz = dvv/dy + dvz/dz.] 1.2. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 19 1.2.5 The Curl From the definition of V we construct the curl: V x v = x y z 3/3x 3/3y 3/3z vx vy vz dvz _ 3t^\\ „ /dvx 3y dz ) y V 3z 3uA . /dv y dvx dx ) \\ 3x 3y (1.41) Notice that the curl of a vector function v is, like any cross product, a vector. (You cannot have the curl of a scalar; that’s meaningless.) Geometrical Interpretation: The name curl is also well chosen, for V x v is a measure of how much the vector v “curls around” the point in question. Thus the three functions in Fig. 1.18 all have zero curl (as you can easily check for yourself), whereas the functions in Fig. 1.19 have a substantial curl, pointing in the z-direction, as the natural right-hand rule would suggest. Imagine (again) you are standing at the edge of a pond. Float a small paddlewheel (a cork with toothpicks pointing out radially would do); if it starts to rotate, then you placed it at a point of nonzero curl. A whirlpool would be a region of large curl. z Figure 1.19 Example 1.5 y b = xy. Calculate their curls.

(Incidentally, they both have zero divergence, as you might guess from the pictures: nothing is “spreading out”... it just “curls around”) Problem 1.18 Calculate the curls of the vector functions in Prob. 1.15. Problem 1.19 Construct a vector function that has zero divergence and zero curl everywhere.. (A constant will do the job, of course, but make it something a little more interesting than that!) 1.2.6 Product Rules The calculation of ordinary derivatives is facilitated by a number of general rules, such as the sum rule: d , df dg ~T~ (/ + g) ~ b , > dx dx dx the rule for multiplying by a constant: d dx (*/) the product rule: d dg df dx dx dx and the quotient rule: df fd g_ d //\\ _ gdx dx dx\\g) g2 Similar relations hold for the vector derivatives. Thus, V(/ + g) = V/ + Vg, V • (A + B) = (V   A) + (V • B), V x (A + B) = (V x A) + (V x B), and V(kf)=kVf, V • (kX) — k(V   A), V x (kA) — k(V x A), as you can check for yourself. The product rules are not quite so simple. There are two ways to construct a scalar as the product of two functions: fg (product of two scalar functions), A   B (dot product of two vector functions), and two ways to make a vector: /A (scalar times vector), A x B (cross product of two vectors). 1.2. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 21 Accordingly, there are six product rules, two for gradients: W V(fg) = fVg+gVf, (ii) V(A • B) = A x (V x B) + B x (V x A) + (A   V)B + (B • V)A, two for divergences: (iii) V-(/A) = /(V-A)+A-(V/), (iv) V   (A x B) = B • (V x A) - A • (V x B), and two for curls: (v) V x (/A) = /(V x A) - A x (V/), (vi) V x (A x B) = (B • V)A - (A • V)B + A(V • B) - B(V • A). You will be using these product rules so frequently that I have put them on the inside front cover for easy reference. The proofs come straight from the product rule for ordinary derivatives. For instance, V • (/A) dx - ,d l A , fd A * ~ [d xAx + f^ 7 + 3 y 3 y -^1 + 1^ . + / (V/)-A + /(V-A). 3 z .9 Az 3 z It is also possible to formulate three quotient rules: _ gvf-fvg \\g) 82 ’ v /A\\ _ g(y • A) - A • (Vg) \\g/ g2 7/ A A = g(V x A) + A X (Vg) \\g / g2 However, since these can be obtained quickly from the corresponding product rules, I haven’t bothered to put them on the inside front cover. 22 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS Problem 1.20 Prove product rules (i), (iv), and (v). Problem 1.21 (a) If A and B are two vector functions, what does the expression (A   V)B mean? (That is, what are its x, y, and z components in terms of the Cartesian components of A, B, and V ?) (b) Compute (r • V)r, where r is the unit vector defined in Eq. 1.21. (c) For the functions in Prob. 1.15, evaluate (va   V)v^. Problem 1.22 (For masochists only.) Prove product rules (ii) and (vi). Refer to Prob. 1.21 for the definition of (A   V)B. Problem 1.23 Derive the three quotient rules. Problem 1.24 (a) Check product rule (iv) (by calculating each term separately) for the functions A = x x + 2y y + 3zz; B = 3yx — 2xy. (b) Do the same for product rule (ii). (c) The same for rule (vi). 1.2.7 Second Derivatives The gradient, the divergence, and the curl are the only first derivatives we can make with V; by applying V twice we can construct five species of second derivatives. The gradient V T is a vector, so we can take the divergence and curl of it: (1) Divergence of gradient: V   (VT). (2) Curl of gradient: V x (VT). The divergence V • v is a scalar—all we can do is take its gradient: (3) Gradient of divergence: V(V • v). The curl V x v is a vector, so we can take its divergence and curl: (4) Divergence of curl: V   (V x v). (5) Curl of curl: V x (V x v). This exhausts the possibilities, and in fact not all of them give anything new. Let’s consider them one at a time: (1) V   (VT) /„ 3 „ 3 „ 3 ' x-b y-1- z — \\ dx dy dz, 92T 92T 92T dx2 dy2 dz2 9T „ 9T„ —x-l-y + dx dy 9T dz (1.42) 1.2. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 23 This object, which we write V2T for short, is called the Laplacian of T; we shall be studying it in great detail later on. Notice that the Laplacian of a scalar T is a scalar. Occasionally, we shall speak of the Laplacian of a vector, V2v. By this we mean a vector quantity whose x-component is the Laplacian of vx, and so on:3 V2v = (V2v x)x + (V2vy)y + (V2v z)z. (1.43) This is nothing more than a convenient extension of the meaning of V2. (2) T he curl of a gradient is always zero: V x (VT) =0. (1.44) This is an important fact, which we shall use repeatedly; you can easily prove it from the definition of V, Eq. 1.39. Beware: You might think Eq. 1.44 is “obviously” true—isn’t it just (V x V)T, and isn’t the cross product of any vector (in this case, V) with itself always zero? This reasoning is suggestive but not quite conclusive, since V is an operator and does not “multiply” in the usual way. The proof of Eq. 1.44, in fact, hinges on the equality of cross derivatives: a /ar\\ _ a /ar dx \\dy ) dy \\ dx (1.45) If you think I’m being fussy, test your intuition on this one: (VT ) x (VS). Is that always zero? (It would be, of course, if you replaced the V’s by an ordinary vector.) (3) V(V • v) for some reason seldom occurs in physical applications, and it has not been given any special name of its own—it’s just the gradient of the divergence. Notice that V(V • v) is not the same as the Laplacian of a vecfor: V2v = (V • V)v V(V • v). (4) The divergence of a curl, like the curl of a gradient, is always zero: V   (V x v) = 0. (1.46) You can prove this for yourself. (Again, there is a fraudulent short-cut proof, using the vector identity A • (B x C) = (A x B) • C.) (5) As you can check from the definition of V: V x (V x v) = V(V • v) - V2v. (1.47) So curl-of-curl gives nothing new; the first term is just number (3) and the second is the Laplacian (of a vector). (In fact, Eq. 1.47 is often used to define the Laplacian of a vector, in preference to Eq. 1.43, which makes specific reference to Cartesian coordinates.) Really, then, there are just two kinds of second derivatives: the Laplacian (which is of fundamental importance) and the gradient-of-divergence (which we seldom encounter). 3 In curvilinear coordinates, where the unit vectors themselves depend on position, they too must be differentiated (see Sect. 1.4.1). 24 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS We could go through a similar ritual to work out third derivatives, but fortunately second derivatives suffice for practically all physical applications. A final word on vector differential calculus: It all flows from the operator V, and from taking seriously its vector character. Even if you remembered only the definition of V, you should be able, in principle, to reconstruct all the rest. Problem 1.25 Calculate the Laplacian of the following functions: (a) T a = x2 + 2xy + 3z + 4. (b) Tj, = sin* siny sinz. (c) Tc = e~^x sin4ycos3z. (d) v = x2 x + 3*z2 y — 2*z z. Problem 1.26 Prove that the divergence of a curl is always zero. Check it for function v„ in Prob. 1.15. Problem 1.27 Prove that the curl of a gradient is always zero. Check it for function (b) in Prob. 1.11. L.3 Integral Calculus 1.3.1 Line, Surface, and Volume Integrals In electrodynamics we encounter several different kinds of integrals, among which the most important are line (or path) integrals, surface integrals (or flux), and volume integrals, (a) Line Integrals. A line integral is an expression of the form (1.48) where v is a vector function, dl is the infinitesimal displacement vector (Eq. 1.22), and the integral is to be carried out along a prescribed path V from point a to point b (Fig. 1.20). If the path in question forms a closed loop (that is, if b = a), I shall put a circle on the integral sign: Av-dl. (1.49) At each point on the path we take the dot product of v (evaluated at that point) with the displacement d\\ to the next point on the path. To a physicist, the most familiar example of a line integral is the work done by a force F: W = f F   c/1. Ordinarily, the value of a line integral depends critically on the particular path taken from a to b, but there is an important special class of vector functions for which the line integral is independent of the path, and is determined entirely by the end points. It will be our business in due course to characterize this special class of vectors. (A force that has this property is called conservative.) 1.3. INTEGRAL CALCULUS 25 Figure 1.20 Figure 1.21 Example 1.6 Calculate the line integral of the function v = y2 x + 2x(y + 1) y from the point a = (1, 1,0) to the point b = (2, 2, 0), along the paths (1) and (2) in Fig. 1.21. What is / v • d\\ for the loop that goes from a to b along (1) and returns to a along (2)? Solution: As always, d\\ = dxx + dyy + dzi. Path (1) consists of two parts. Along the “horizontal” segment dy = dz = 0, so (i) dl = dx x, y = 1, v • d\\ = y2 dx = dx, so f v • dl = f 2 dx = 1. On the “vertical” stretch dx = dz = 0, so (ii) dl = dyy, x = 2, v   dl = 2x(y + 1) dy = 4(y + 1 )dy, so fy-dl By path (1), then, 4 if O'+ 1 )dy = 10. f vd\\= 1 + 10 = 11. Meanwhile, on path (2) x = y, dx = dy, and dz = 0, so dl = dx x + dx y, v • dl = x2 dx + 2x(x + 1) dx = (3x2 + 2x) dx, so />-/ = j (3x + 2x) dx = (jr + = 10. (The strategy here is to get everything in terms of one variable; I could just as well have eliminated v in favor of y.) For the loop that goes out (1) and back (2), then, v   dl — 11-10= 1. 26 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS (b) Surface Integrals. A surface integral is an expression of the form where v is again some vector function, and da is an infinitesimal patch of area, with direction perpendicular to the surface (Fig. 1.22). There are, of course, two directions perpendicular to any surface, so the sign of a surface integral is intrinsically ambiguous. If the surface is closed (forming a '“balloon\"), in which case I shall again put a circle on the integral sign <j) v • da, then tradition dictates that “outward” is positive, but for open surfaces it’s arbitrary. If v describes the flow of a fluid (mass per unit area per unit time), then f v   da represents the total mass per unit time passing through the surface—hence the alternative name, “flux.” Ordinarily, the value of a surface integral depends on the particular surface chosen, but there is a special class of vector functions for which it is independent of the surface, and is determined entirely by the boundary line. We shall soon be in a position to characterize this special class. (iv) (i) I (hi) 2 y Figure 1.22 Figure 1.23 Example 1.7 Calculate the surface integral of v = 2xz x + (x + 2) y + y (z2 — 3) z over five sides (excluding the bottom) of the cubical box (side 2) in Fig. 1.23. Let “upward and outward” be the positive direction, as indicated by the arrows. Solution: Taking the sides one at a time: (i) x = 2, da = dy dzx, v   da = 2 xz dy dz = 4 z dy dz, so v • da = 4 /V zdz = 16. (ii) x = 0, da = —dy dzii, y-da — —2 xz dy dz = 0, so v • da = 0. 1.3. INTEGRAL CALCULUS 27 (iii) y = 2, da = dx dzy, v   da = (x + 2) dx dz, so f v • da = f (x + 2) dx f dz = 12. J Jo Jo (iv) y = 0, da = —dx dzy, v • da = — ix + 2) dx dz, so f y   da = — f (x + 2) dx f dz = —12. 7 7o 7o (v) z = 2, da = dx dy z, y   da = y(z2 — 3) t/x dy = v t/x so r2 ,2 /y   da = j dx I ydy = 4. Jo Jo Evidently the total flux is L V da = 16 + 0+ 12- 12 + 4 = 20. surface (c) Volume Integrals. A volume integral is an expression of the form / T dz, (1.51) Jv where T is a scalar function and dz is an infinitesimal volume element. In Cartesian coordinates, dz = dxdy dz, (1-52) For example, if T is the density of a substance (which might vary from point to point), then the volume integral would give the total mass. Occasionally we shall encounter volume integrals of vector functions: / YdZ = j (vx x + vy y + vz z)dz = x j vxd z + y j vyd z + i J vzdz\\ (1.53) because the unit vectors are constants, they come outside the integral. Example 1.8 Calculate the volume integral of T = xyz2 over the prism in Fig. 1.24. Solution: You can do the three integrals in any order. Let’s do x first: it runs from 0 to (1 — y); then y (it goes from 0 to 1); and finally z (0 to 3): 28 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS Figure 1.24 Problem 1.28 Calculate the line integral of the function v = x2 x + 2yz v + y~z from the origin to the point (1,1,1) by three different routes: (a) (0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,0) (1, 1,1); (b) (0,0,0) (0,0, 1) (0,1,1) (1, 1, 1); (c) The direct straight line. (d) What is the line integral around the closed loop that goes out along path (a) and back along path (b)? Problem 1.29 Calculate the surface integral of the function in Ex. 1.7, over the bottom of the box. For consistency, let “upward” be the positive direction. Does the surface integral depend only on the boundary line for this function? What is the total flux over the closed surface of the box (including the bottom)? [Note: For the closed surface the positive direction is “outward,” and hence “down,” for the bottom face.] Problem 1.30 Calculate the volume integral of the function T = z2 over the tetrahedron with comers at (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). 1.3.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Suppose fix) is a function of one variable. The fundamental theorem of calculus states: f b ‘j-dx = f{b) - f(a). (1.54) J a dx In case this doesn’t look familiar, let’s write it another way: b Fix) dx = f{b) - fia), where df/dx = Fix). The fundamental theorem tells you how to integrate F(x): you think up a function fix) whose derivative is equal to F. 1.3. INTEGRAL CALCULUS 29 Geometrical Interpretation: According to Eq. 1.33, df = (dfjdx)dx is the infinitesi¬ mal change in / when you go from (x) to (x + dx). The fundamental theorem (1.54) says that if you chop the interval from a to b (Fig. 1.25) into many tiny pieces, dx, and add up the increments df from each little piece, the result is (not surprisingly) equal to the total change in /: f(b) — f(a). In other words, there are two ways to determine the total change in the function: either subtract the values at the ends or go step-by-step, adding up all the tiny increments as you go. You’ll get the same answer either way. Notice the basic format of the fundamental theorem: the integral of a derivative over an interval is given by the value of the function at the end points (boundaries). In vector calculus there are three species of derivative (gradient, divergence, and curl), and each has its own “fundamental theorem,” with essentially the same format. I don’t plan to prove these theorems here; rather, I shall explain what they mean, and try to make them plausible. Proofs are given in Appendix A. Figure 1.25 Figure 1.26 1.3.3 The Fundamental Theorem for Gradients Suppose we have a scalar function of three variables T(x, y, z). Starting at point a, we move a small distance d\\\\ (Fig. 1.26). According to Eq. 1.37, the function T will change by an amount dT = (VT) -d\\i. Now we move a little further, by an additional small displacement dty, the incremental change in T will be (V7’) • d\\2. In this manner, proceeding by infinitesimal steps, we make the journey to point b. At each step we compute the gradient of T (at that point) and dot it into the displacement dl... this gives us the change in T. Evidently the total change in T in going from a to b along the path selected is V (VT)-dl = T (b) T( a). (1.55) 30 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS This is called the fundamental theorem for gradients; like the “ordinary” fundamental theorem, it says that the integral (here a line integral) of a derivative (here the gradient) is given by the value of the function at the boundaries (a and b). Geometrical Interpretation: Suppose you wanted to determine the height of the Eiffel Tower. You could climb the stairs, using a ruler to measure the rise at each step, and adding them all up (that’s the left side of Eq. 1.55), or you could place altimeters at the top and the bottom, and subtract the two readings (that’s the right side); you should get the same answer either way (that’s the fundamental theorem). Incidentally, as we found in Ex. 1.6, line integrals ordinarily depend on the path taken from a to b. But the right side of Eq. 1.55 makes no reference to the path—only to the end points. Evidently, gradients have the special property that their line integrals are path independent: Corollary 1: f* (V T)   d\\ is independent of path taken from a to b. Corollary 2: /(V T )   dl — 0, since the beginning and end points are identical, and hence T(b) — T (a) = 0. Example 1.9 Let T = xy2, and take point a to be the origin (0, 0. 0) and b the point (2, 1,0). Check the fundamental theorem for gradients. Solution: Although the integral is independent of path, we must pick a specific path in order to evaluate it. Let’s go out along the x axis (step i) and then up (step ii) (Fig. 1.27). As always, dl = dxx + dy y + dzi',VT = y2x + 2xy y. (i) y = 0; dl = dxx, VT   dl = y2 dx = 0, so fvT • dl = 0. (ii) x =2\\ dl = dy y, VT   dl = 2xy dy = Ay dy, so L VT dl = 2 y2 i = 2. 0 Figure 1.27 1.3. INTEGRAL CALCULUS 31 Evidently the total line integral is 2. Is this consistent with the fundamental theorem? Yes: r(b) - T(a) =2-0 = 2. Now, just to convince you that the answer is independent of path, let me calculate the same integral along path iii (the straight line from a to b): (iii) y = jx, dy = | dx. VT   dl = y2 dx + 2xydy = | x 2 dx, so f VT d\\= [ 2 J iii JO I* 2 dx = ix 3 = 2. Problem 1.31 Check the fundamental theorem for gradients, using T = x2 + 4xy + 2yz2, the points a = (0, 0, 0), b = (1, 1, 1), and the three paths in Fig. 1.28: (a) (0,0,0) -> (1.0,0) (I. 1,0) (1, 1. 1); (b) (0,0.0) (0,0, 1) ^ (0, 1, 1) ^ (1, 1, 1); (c) the parabolic path z = x2\\ y = x. 1.3.4 The Fundamehtal Theorem for Divergences The fundamental theorem for divergences states that: J (V • v) dr = j2 v • da. V S (1.56) In honor, I suppose of its great importance, this theorem has at least three special names: Gauss’s theorem, Green’s theorem, or, simply, the divergence theorem. Like the other “fundamental theorems,” it says that the integral of a derivative (in this case the divergence) over a region (in this case a volume) is equal to the value of the function at the boundary 32 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS (in this case the surface that bounds the volume). Notice that the boundary term is itself an integral (specifically, a surface integral). This is reasonable: the “boundary” of a line is just two end points, but the boundary of a volume is a (closed) surface. Geometrical Interpretation: If v represents the flow of an incompressible fluid, then the flux of v (the right side of Eq. 1.56) is the total amount of fluid passing out through the surface, per unit time. Now, the divergence measures the “spreading out” of the vectors from a point—a place of high divergence is like a “faucet,” pouring out liquid. If we have lots of faucets in a region filled with incompressible fluid, an equal amount of liquid will be forced out through the boundaries of the region. In fact, there are two ways we could determine how much is being produced: (a) we could count up all the faucets, recording how much each puts out, or (b) we could go around the boundary, measuring the flow at each point, and add it all up. You get the same answer either way: J (faucets within the volume) = j) (flow out through the surface). This, in essence, is what the divergence theorem says. Example 1.10 Check the divergence theorem using the function v = y2 x + (2xy + z2) y + (2yz) i and the unit cube situated at the origin (Fig. 1.29). Solution: In this case and V • v = 2(x + y). f 2(x + y) dr = 2 f f f (x + y)dxdydz, i, Jo Jo Jo + y)dx = \\+y. f dz = 1. Figure 1.29 1.3. INTEGRAL CALCULUS 33 Evidently, / V • ydz = 2. V So much for the left side of the divergence theorem. To evaluate the surface integral we must consider separately the six sides of the cube: (i) j v   da = j j y2dy dz = (ii) j v da = —J j y2d ydz = —\\. (iii) j\\da = j j (2x + z2) dx dz = \\. (iv) j v • da = — j J z2d xdz = —\\. (v) I v • da = I 1 2ydxdy = l. J Jo Jo (vi) f \\   da = — f f Odx dy = 0. J Jo Jo So the total flux is: ^ v   da = j — j + | — ^ + 1+ 0 = 2, 5 as expected. Problem 1.32 Test the divergence theorem for the function v = (xy) x + (2yz) y + (3zx) z. Take as your volume the cube shown in Fig. 1.30, with sides of length 2. 34 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS 1.3.5 The Fundamental Theorem for Curls The fundamental theorem for curls, which goes by the special name of Stokes’ theorem, states that / (V x y)   da = £v • dl. V (1.57) As always, the integral of a derivative (here, the curl) over a region (here, a {latch of surface) is equal to the value of the function at the boundary (hbre, the perimeter of the patch). As in the case of the divergence theorem, the boundary term is itself an integral—specifically, a closed line integral. Geometrical Interpretation: Recall that the curl measures the “twist” of the vectors v; a region of high curl is a whirlpool—if you put a tiny paddle wheel there, it will rotate. Now, the integral of the curl over some surface (or, more precisely, the flux of the curl through that surface) represents the “total amount of swirl,” and we can determine that swirl just as well by going around the edge and finding how much the flow is following the boundary (Fig. 1.31). You may find this a rather forced interpretation of Stokes’ theorem, but it’s a helpful mnemonic, if nothing else. You might have noticed an apparent ambiguity in Stokes’ theorem: concerning the boundary line integral, which way are we supposed to go around (clockwise or counter¬ clockwise)? If we go the “wrong” way we’ll pick up an overall sign error. The answer is that it doesn’t matter which way you go as long as you are consistent, for there is a com¬ pensating sign ambiguity in the surface integral: Which way does da point? For a closed surface (as in the divergence theorem) da points in the direction of the outward normal; but for an open surface, which way is “out?” Consistency in Stokes’ theorem (as in all such matters) is given by the right-hand rule: If your fingers point in the direction of the line integral, then your thumb fixes the direction of da (Fig. 1.32). Now, there are plenty of surfaces (infinitely many) that share any given boundary line. Twist a paper clip into a loop and dip it in soapy water. The soap film constitutes a surface, with the wire loop as its boundary. If you blow on it, the soap film will expand, making a larger surface, with the same boundary. Ordinarily, a flux integral depends critically on what surface you integrate over, but evidently this is not the case with curls. For Stokes’ 1.3. INTEGRAL CALCULUS 35 (O) Figure 1.31 Figure 1.32 theorem says that /(V x v) • da is equal to the line integral of v around the boundary, and the latter makes no reference to the specific surface you choose. Corollary 1: /(V x v)   da depends only on the boundary line, not on the particular surface used. Corollary 2: <p (V x v)   da — 0 for any closed surface, since the boundary line, like the mouth of a balloon, shrinks down to a point, and hence the right side of Eq. 1.57 vanishes. These corollaries are analogous to those for the gradient theorem. We shall develop the parallel further in due course. Example 1.11 Suppose v = (2xz + 3y2)y + (4yz2)z. Check Stokes’ theorem for the square surface shown in Fig. 1.33. Solution: Here V x v = (4z2 - 2x)x + 2zz and da = dydzx. Z ' 1 (hi) (iv)l t(ii) V (5 1 1 y Figure 1.33 36 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS (In saying that da points in the x direction, we are committing ourselves to a counterclockwise line integral. We could as well write da = -dy dz x, but then we would be obliged to go clockwise.) Since x = 0 for this surface, /(V x v) • da = / j 4z2 dydz=\\. Now, what about the line integral? We must break this up into four segments: So (i) x =0 , z = 0, v • d\\ = 3y2 dy, /v 'd ] = Jo ^y2d y = i. (ii) x = 0, y = 1, v   d\\ = 4z2 dz. /v   d\\ = /q 4z2 dz = 5, (iii) X = 0 , z = 1, v   d\\ = 3y2 dy, /v 'd l = fi 3y2d y = - 1, (iv) x = 0. y = 0, o' II > h-  d l = jf Odz = 0. v-fifl = l + | — 1 + 0= It checks. A point of strategy: notice how I handled step (iii). There is a temptation to write d\\ = —dy y here, since the path goes to the left. You can get away with this, if you insist, by running the integral from 0 —º 1. Personally, I prefer to say d\\ = dxx + dyy + dzi always (never any minus signs) and let the limits of the integral take care of the direction. Problem 1.33 Test Stokes’ theorem for the function v = (xy) x + (2yz) y + (3zx) z, using the triangular shaded area of Fig. 1.34. Problem 1.34 Check Corollary I by using the same function and boundary line as in Ex. 1.11, but integrating over the five sides of the cube in Fig. 1.35. The back of the cube is open. Figure 1.34 Figure 1.35 1.3. INTEGRAL CALCULUS 37 1.3.6 Integration by Parts The technique known (awkwardly) as integration by parts exploits the product rule for derivatives: d (dg -r {fg) = f[-r dx \\dx + g dJ_ dx Integrating both sides, and invoking the fundamental theorem: That’s integration by parts. It pertains to the situation in which you are called upon to integrate the product of one function (/) and the derivative of another (g): it says you can transfer the derivative from g to f, at the cost of a minus sign and a boundary term. Example 1.12 Evaluate the integral r Jo xe x dx. Solution: The exponential can be expressed as a derivative: dx in this case, then, f(x) = x, g(x) = —e~x, and df/dx = 1, so poo pc I xe~ x dx = I e~x dx — xe~ x Jo Jo oo = 1. 0 We can exploit the product rules of vector calculus, together with the appropriate fun¬ damental theorems, in exactly the same way. For example, integrating V-(/A) = /(V-A)+A.(V/) over a volume, and invoking the divergence theorem, yields J V • (fA)dr = j /(V • A)dz + J A   (V/) dz = <j> /A • da, f /(V   A) dr = - f A   ('Vf)dz + (f /A • da.

VECTOR ANALYSIS Here again the integrand is the product of one function (/) and the derivative (in this case the divergence) of another (A), and integration by parts licenses us to transfer the derivative from A to / (where it becomes a gradient), at the cost of a minus sign and a boundary term (in this case a surface integral). You might wonder how often one is likely to encounter an integral involving the product of one function and the derivative of another; the answer is surprisingly often, and integration by parts turns out to be one of the most powerful tools in vector calculus.

Their relation to Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z.) can be read from the figure: x — r sin 0 cos 0, y = r sin# sin 0, z = rcos9. (1-62) Figure 1.36 1.4. CURVILINEAR COORDINATES 39 Figure 1.36 also shows three unit vectors, r, 6. (j>, pointing in the direction of increase of the corresponding coordinates. They constitute an orthogonal (mutually perpendicular) basis set (just like x, y, z), and any vector A can be expressed in terms of them in the usual way: A = Ar r + Ag 6 + A,p <!>. (1.63) Ar, Aq, and are the radial, polar, and azimuthal components of A. In terms of the Cartesian unit vectors. r = sin 0 cos </> x + sin 6 sin </> y + cos 0 z, 6 = cos 0 cos </> x + cos 6 sin (j>$ — sin 6 z, <j> = — sin</>x + cos</>y, (1.64) as you can easily check for yourself (Prob. 1.37). I have put these formulas inside the back cover, for easy reference. But there is a poisonous snake lurking here that I’d better warn you about: r, 6, and $ are associated with a particular point P , and they change direction as P moves around. For example, r always points radially outward, but “radially outward” can be the jc direction, the y direction, or any other direction, depending on where you are. In Fig. 1.37, A = y and B = —y, and yet both of them would be written aS r in spherical coofdinates. One could take account of this by explicitly indicating the point of reference: r(0, <f>), 0(0. <f>), 4>(0. </>), but this would be cumbersome, and as long as you are alert to the problem I don’t think it will cause difficulties.4 In particular, do not naively combihe the spherical components of vectors associated with different points (in Fig. 1.37, A + B = 0, not 2?, and A • B = -1, not +1). Beware of differentiating a vector that is expressed in spherical coordinates, since the unit vectors themselves are functions of position (3f/30 = 0, for example). And do not take r, 6, and 4> outside an integral, as we did with x, y, and z in Eq. 1.53. In general, if you’re uncertain about the validity of an operation, reexpress the problem in Cartesian coordinates, where this difficulty does not arise. Figure 1.37 4I claimed on the very first page that vectors have no location, and I’ll stand by that. The vectors themselves live “out there,” completely independertt of our choice of coordinates. But the notation we use to represent them does depend on the point in question, in curvilinear coordinates. 40 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS An infinitesimal displacement in the r direction is simply dr (Fig. 1.38a), just as an infinitesimal element of length in the x direction is dx: dlr = dr. (1.65) On the other hand, an infinitesimal element of length in the 0 direction (Fig. 1.38b) is not just d9 (that’s an angle—it doesn’t even have the right units for a length), but rather r d9: dlg=rd0. (1.66) Similarly, an infinitesimal element of length in the 0 direction (Fig. 1,38c) is r sin 0 dtp-. dl^ = r sin 9 dtp. (1-67) Thus, the general infinitesimal displacement dl is d\\ = dr r + r d9 0 + r sin 9 dtp <j>. (1.68) This plays the role (in line integrals, for example) that d\\ = dx x + dy y + dz z played in Cartesian coordinates. r dQ (a) (b) (c) Figure 1.38 The infinitesimal volume element dr, in spherical coordinates, is the product of the three infinitesimal displacements: dx = dlr dig dlrf, = r2 sin 9 dr d9 dtp. (1-69) I cannot give you a general expression for surface elements da, since these depend on the orientation of the surface. You simply have to analyze the geometry for any given case (this goes for Cartesian and curvilinear coordinates alike). If you are integrating over the surface of a sphere, for instance, then r is constant, whereas 9 and tp change (Fig. 1.39), so da\\ = dig dl^ r = r2 sin 9 d9 dtp r. On the other hand, if the surface lies in the xy plane, say, so that 9 is constant (to wit: tt/2) while r and tp vary, then da 2 — dlr dl,), 6 = r dr dtp 6. rsin0 1.4. CURVILINEAR COORDINATES 41 Figure 1.39 Notice, finally, that r ranges from 0 to oo, <£ from 0 to 2n, and 9 from 0 to n (not 2n—that would count every point twice).5 Example 1.13 Find the volume of a sphere of radius R. Solution: V (Not a big surprise.) rR p r r2n dr = / / / r^sinOdrdOdip Jr=0 J0=0 J<t>=0 So far we have talked only about the geometry of spherical coordinates. Now I would like to “translate” the vector derivatives (gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian) into r, 9, <j> notation. In principle this is entirely straightforward: in the case of the gradient, 9F 97\\ 97\\ VT = —x4-yH-z, dx dyy dz for instance, we would first use the chain rule to reexpress the partials: 9F_9F/9r\\ 9T /96>\\ dT /9<A dx dr \\9x ) + d9 \\9x ) + d<f> \\dx ) ' 5 Alternatively, you could run from 0 to jr (the “eastern hemisphere”) and cover the “western hemisphere” by extending 6 from jr up to 2n. But this is very bad notation, since, among other things, sin 8 will then run negative, and you’ll have to put absolute value signs around that term in volume and surface elements (area and volume being intrinsically positive quantities). 42 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS The terms in parentheses could he worked out from Eq. 1.62—or rather, the inverse of those equations (Prob. 1.36). Theq we’d do the same for 3T /3 y and 3T /3 z. Finally, we’d substitute in the formulas for x, y, and z in terms of r, 8, and </> (Prob. 1.37). It would take an hour to figure out the gradient in spherical coordinates by this brute-force method. I suppose this is how it was first done, but there is a much more efficient indirect approach, explained in Appendix A, which has the extra advantage of treating all coordinate systems at once. I described the “straightforward” method only to show you that there is nothing subtle or mysterious about transforming to spherical coordinates: you’re expressing the same quantity (gradient, divergence, or whatever) in different notation, that’s all. Here, then, are the vector derivatives in spherical coordinates: Gradient: Divergence: 37\\ 13T f. 1 37, —r 4- 6 4- tp dr r dO r sin 9 3tp (1-70) V 1 3 r2 dr (r2vr) 4- 1 3 r sin 6 36 (sin 6%) 4- 1 r sin 6 dtp (1.71) Curl: V x v 1 ' 3 r sin0 _30 1 r 3 r ir\\rvg) dr (sin 0i^) 3IV \"30\" dve dtp r + l 1 3iy r [_sin0 dtp 3 Yr^ 8 (1.72) Laplacian: 1 3 / 23 T\\ 1 3 1 d2T r2 dr \\ 3r ) \"* *\" r2 sin 6 30 \\ 30 ) + r2 sin2 0 dtp2 (1.73) For reference, these formulas are listed inside the front cover.

Problem 1.40 Compute the gradient and Laplacian of the function T = r(cos 8 + sin 8 cos tp). Check the Laplacian by converting T to Cartesian coordinates and using Eq. 1.42. Test the gradient theorem for this function, using the path shown in Fig. 1.41, from (0, 0, 0) to (0, 0, 2). 1.4.2 Cylindrical Coordinates The cylindrical coordinates (s,<p,z) of a point P are defined in Fig. 1.42. Notice that f has the same meaning as in spherical coordinates, and z is the same as Cartesian; 5 is the distance to P from the z axis, whereas the spherical coordinate r is the distance from the origin. The relation to Cartesian coordinates is x=scos<f>, y = sshuj), z = z. The unit vectors (Prob. 1.41) are s = cos f x + sin <f y, 0 = — sin f x + cos (j> y, z = z.

(c) Find the curl of v. 1.5 The Dirac Delta Function 1.5.1 The Divergence of r/r 2 Consider the vector function (1.83) At every location, v is directed radially outward (Fig. 1.44); if ever there was a function that ought to have a large positive divergence, this is it. And yet, when you actually calculate the divergence (using Eq. 1.71), you get precisely zero: 1 9 r2 dr 1 9 - 2^ - 0 ) =°. rz dr (1.84) (You will have encountered this paradox already, if you worked Prob. 1.16.) The plot thickens if you apply the divergence theorem to this function. Suppose we integrate over a sphere of radius R, centered at the origin (Prob. 1,38b); the surface integral is i v • da f) = 47T. (1.85) 46 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS But the volume integral, / V • ydr, is zero, if we are really to believe Eq. 1.84. Does this mean that the divergence theorem is false? What’s going on here? The source of the problem is the point r = 0, where v blows up (and where, in Eq. 1.84, we have unwittingly divided by zero). It is quite true that V • v = 0 everywhere except the origin, but right at the origin the situation is more complicated. Notice that the surface integral (1.85) is independent of R\\ if the divergence theorem is right (and it is), we should get /(V • v) dr = 4jt for any sphere centered at the origin, no matter how small. Evidently the entire contribution must be coming from the point r — 0! Thus, V • v has the bizarre property that it vanishes everywhere except at one point, and yet its integral (over any volume containing that point) is 4n. No ordinary function behaves like that. (On the other hand, a physical example does come to mind: the density (mass per unit volume) of a point particle. It’s zero except at the exact location of the particle, and yet its integral is finite— namely, the mass of the particle.) What we have stumbled on is a mathematical object known to physicists as the Dirac delta function. It arises in many branches of theoretical physics. Moreover, the specific problem at hand (the divergence of the function r / r2) is not just some arcane curiosity—it is, in fact, central to the whole theory of electrodynamics. So it is worthwhile to pause here and study the Dirac delta function with some care. 1.5.2 The One-Dimensional Dirac Delta Function The one dimensional Dirac delta function, Six), can be pictured as an infinitely high, infinitesimally narrow “spike,” with area 1 (Fig. 1.45). That is to say: <5W = 0, oo, if x 0 if x = 0 (1.86) and <5(jt) dx — 1. (1.87) Technically, <5(jt) is not a function at all, since its value is not finite at x =0. In the mathematical literature it is known as a generalized function, or distribution. It is, if you Figure 1.45 1.5. THE DIRAC DELTA FUNCTION 47 Figure 1.46 like, the limit of a sequence of functions, such as rectangles R„(x), of height n and width 1/m, or isosceles triangles Tn (x), of height n and base 2/m (Fig. 1.46). If /(x) is some “ordinary” function (that is, not another delta function—in fact, just to be on the safe side let’s say that /(x) is continuous), then the product f{x)S(x) is zero everywhere except at x = 0. It follows that f(x)8(x) = f(0)S(x). (1.88) (This is the most important fact about the delta function, so make sure you understand why it is true: since the product is zero anyway except at x = 0, we may as well replace /(x) by the value it assumes at the origin.) In particular /OO /.OO f(x)8(x)dx = f( 0) / 8(x)dx = f{ 0). (1.89) -OO J-o O Under an integral, then, the delta function “picks out” the value of f(x) at x =0. (Flere and below, the integral need not run from -oo to +oo; it is sufficient that the domain extend across the delta function, and -e to +e would do as well.) Of course, we can shift the spike from x = 0 to some other point, x = a (Fig. 1.47): s, . f 0, if x ^ a ] i<X“ \" ) = | oo, if,= f l ] W1,h <L 90 > Equation 1.88 becomes f(x)S(x - a) — f(a)8(x - a), (1.91) andEq. 1.89 generalizes to f(x)8(x - a)dx = f(a). (1.92) Example 1.14 L 3 x36(x — 2) dx . Evaluate the integral 48 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS b(x - a) - Area 1 Figure 1.47 Solution: The delta function picks out the value of x3 at the point x = 2, so the integral is 23 = 8. Notice, however, that if the upper limit had been 1 (instead of 3) the answer would be 0, because the spike would then be outside the domain of integration. Although S itself is not a legitimate function, integrals over <5 are perfectly acceptable. In fact, it’s best to think of the delta function as something that is always intended for use under an integral sign. In particular, two expressions involving delta functions (say, D\\( x) and D 2(x)) are considered equal if 6 /OO POO f(x)Di(x)dx = / f (x)D 2(x) dx, (1.93) -OO J — OO for all (“ordinary”) functions f(x). Example 1.15 Show that &{kx) = (1-94) where k is any (nonzero) constant. (In particular, 8( —x) = <5(x).) Solution: For an arbitrary test function /(x), consider the integral /OO f(x)8(kx)dx. -OO Changing variables, we let y = kx, so that x = y/k, and dx = l/kdy. If k is positive, the integration still runs from — oo to +oo, but if k is negative, then x = oo implies y = — oo, and 6This is not as arbitrary as it may sound. The crucial point is that the integrals must be equal for any f(x). Suppose D\\ (x) and D 2( x) actually differed, say, in the neighborhood of the point x = 17. Then we could pick a function f (x) that was sharply peaked about x = 17, and the integrals would not be equal. 1.5. THE DIRAC DELTA FUNCTION 49 vice versa, so the order of the limits is reversed. Restoring the “proper” order costs a minus sign. Thus f°° dy 11 / f(x)S(kx)dx = ± / f(y/k)S(y)-^ = ±-/(0) = —/(0). (The lower signs apply when k is negative, and we account for this neatly by putting absolute value bars around the final k, as indicated.) Under the integral sign, then, S(kx) serves the same purpose as (l/|£|)<5(x): /oo /-oo r j f (x)S(kx) dx = I f(x) —S(x) dx. -oo J-O0 l\\k\\ According to criterion 1.93, therefore, S(kx) and (1 /|jfc|)5(jc) are equal.

VECTOR ANALYSIS 1.5.3 The Three-Dimensional Delta Function It is an easy matter to generalize the delta function to three dimensions: 83(r)=8(x)8(y)8(z). (1.96) (As always, r = x x + y y + z z is the position vector, extending from the origin to the point (x, y, z)). This three-dimensional delta function is zero everywhere except at (0, 0, 0), where it blows up. Its volume integral is 1: /» poo poo poo / S3(r)dr = / / / 8(x) 8(y) 8(z)dx dy dz = l.

(1.98) Jail space As in the one-dimensional case, integration with 8 picks out the value of the function / at the location of the spike. We are now in a position to resolve the paradox introduced in Sect. 1.5.1. As you will recall, we found that the divergence of r/r 2 is zero everywhere except at the origin, and yet its integral over any volume containing the origin is a constant (to wit: 4jt). These are precisely the defining conditions for the Dirac delta function; evidently V' (^) = 4 ^ 3(r )- More generally. V • 4 jr<53( *), (1.99) (1.100) where, as always, -t is the separation vector: 4 = r — r'. Note that differentiation here is with respect to r, while r' is held constant. Incidentally, since V 4 -t L2 (1.101) (Prob. 1.13), it follows that V 7- = 4 47r<53( *). (1.10 2) 1.5.

JV This one-line solution demonstrates something of the power and beauty of the delta function, but I would like to show you a second method, which is much more cumbersome but serves to illustrate the method of integration by parts, Sect. 1.3.6. Solution 2: Using Eq. 1.59, we transfer the derivative from r/r 2 to (r2 + 2): J = ~ J   [V(r2 + 2)]rfr + ^(r 2 +2)^ • da. The gradient is V(r2 + 2) = 2rr, so the volume integral becomes J - dr = J -r 2 sinO dr dO dip = Sjt J rdr=4nR 2. Meanwhile, on the boundary of the sphere (where r = R), da = R2 sin 0 dO dip r , so the surface integral becomes J (R2 + 2) sin 9 dO dtp = An{R2 + 2). Putting it all together, then, J = -4nR 2 + An{R2 + 2) = 8?r, as before. 52 CHAPTER 1.

Like many physical laws, these are most compactly expressed as differential equations. Since E and B are vectors, the differential equations naturally involve vector derivatives: divergence and curl. Indeed, Maxwell reduced the entire theory to four equations, specifying respectively the divergence and the curl of E and B.7 7Strictly speaking, this is only true in the static case; in general, the divergence and curl are given in terms of time derivatives of the fields themselves. 1.6 . THE THEORY OF VECTOR FIELDS 53 Maxwell’s formulation raises an important mathematical question: To what extent is a vector function determined by its divergence and curl? In other words, if I tell you that the divergence of F (which stands for E or B, as the case may be) is a specified (scalar) function D, V F =D, and the curl of F is a specified (vector) function C, V x F = C, (for consistency, C must be divergenceless, V • C = 0, because the divergence of a curl is always zero), can you then determine the function F? Well... not quite. For example, as you may have discovered in Prob. 1.19, there are many functions whose divergence and curl are both zero everywhere—the trivial case F = 0, of course, but also F = yzx + zx y+ x y z, F = sin x cosh y x — cos jt sinhy y, etc. To solve a differential equation you must also be supplied with appropriate boundary conditions. In electrodynamics we typically require that the fields go to zero “at infinity’’ (far away from all charges).8 With that extra information the Helmholtz theorem guarantees that the field is uniquely determined by its divergence and curl. (A proof of the Helmholtz theorem is given in Appendix B.) 1.6.2 Potentials If the curl of a vector field (F) vanishes (everywhere), then F can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential (V): V x F = 0 F = -VV. (1.103) (The minus sign is purely conventional.) That’s the essential burden of the following theorem: Theorem 1: Curl-less (or “irrotational”) fields. The following con¬ ditions are equivalent (that is, F satisfies one if and only if it satisfies all the others): (a) V xF = 0 everywhere. (b) / ab F • d\\ is independent of path, for any given end points. (c) (f F • dl — 0 for any closed loop. (d) F is the gradient of some scalar, F = — V V. 8In some textbook problems the charge itself extends to infinity (we speak, for instance, of the electric field of an infinite plane, or the magnetic field of an infinite wire). In such cases the normal boundary conditions do not apply, and one must invoke symmetry arguments to determine the fields uniquely. 54 CHAPTER 1. VECTOR ANALYSIS The scalar potential is not unique—any constant can be added to V with impunity, since this will not affect its gradient. If the divergence of a vector field (F) vanishes (everywhere), then F can be expressed as the curl of a vector potential (A): V • F = 0 4=^ F = V x A. (1.104) That’s the main conclusion of the following theorem: Theorem 2: Divergence-less (or “solenoidal”) fields. The following conditions are equivalent: (a) V • F = 0 everywhere. (b) / F-da is independent of surface, for any given bound¬ ary line. (c) <f F • da = 0 for any closed surface. (d) F is the curl of some vector, F = V x A. The vector potential is not unique—the gradient of any scalar function can be added to A without affecting the curl, since the curl of a gradient is zero. You should by now be able to prove all the connections in these theorems, save for the ones that say (a), (b), or (c) implies (d). Those are more subtle, and will come later. Incidentally, in all cases (whatever its curl and divergence may be) a vector field F can be written as the gradient of a scalar plus the curl of a vector: F = —VV + VxA (always). (1.105) Problem 1.49 (a) Let Fj = x2 i and F 2 = ix + jy + zz. Calculate the divergence and curl of F 1 andF 2 . Which one can be written as the gradient of a scalar? Find a scalar potential that does the job. Which one can be written as the curl of a vector? Find a suitable vector potential.

[Answer: V x (rn r) = 0] Chapter 2 Electrostatics 2.1 The Electric Field 2.1.1 Introduction The fundamental problem electromagnetic theory hopes to solve is this (Fig. 2.1): We have some electric charges, q\\, <72, <73, • • • (call them source charges); what force do they exert on another charge, Q (call it the test charge)? The positions of the source charges are given (as functions of time); the trajectory of the test particle is to be calculated. In general, both the source charges and the test charge are in motion. The solution to this problem is facilitated by the principle of superposition, which states that the interaction between any two charges is completely unaffected by the presence of others. This means that to determine the force on 2, we can first compute the force F 1, due to q 1 alone (ignoring all the others); then we compute the force F 2, due to <72 alone; and so on. Finally, we take the vector sum of all these individual forces: F = Fi + F 2 + F 3 + ... Thus, if we can find the force on Q due to a single source charge q, we are, in principle, done (the rest is just a question of repeating the same operation over and over, and adding it all up). 1 Well, at first sight this sounds very easy: Why don’t I just write down the formula for the force on Q due to q, and be done with it? I could, and in Chapter 10 I shall, but you would be shocked to see it at this stage, for not only does the force on Q depend on the separation distance ^between the charges (Fig. 2.2), it also depends on both their velocities and on the acceleration of q. Moreover, it is not the position, velocity, and acceleration of q right now that matter: Electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light, so what concerns Q is the position, velocity, and acceleration q had at some earlier time, when the message left. ' The principle of superposition may seem “obvious” to you, but it did not have to be so simple: if the electromag¬ netic force were proportional to the square of the total source charge, for instance, the principle of superposition would not hold, since (qy + q2)2 i=- q\\ + (there would be “cross terms” to consider). Superposition is not a logical necessity, but an experimental fact. 58 2.1. THE ELECTRIC FIELD 59 q2» Q Figure 2.1 Figure 2.2 Therefore, in spite of the fact that the basic question (“What is the force on Q due to qT’) is easy to state, it does not pay to confront it head on; rather, we shall go at it by stages. In the meantime, the theory we develop will permit the solution of more subtle electromagnetic problems that do not present themselves in quite this simple format. To begin with, we shall consider the special case of electrostatics in which all the source charges are stationary (though the test charge may be moving). 2.1.2 Coulomb’s Law What is the force on a test charge Q due to a single point charge q which is at rest a distance n, away? The answer (based on experiments) is given by Coulomb’s law: F- 1 qQ k * — ~a- AlC (zQ (2.1) The constant eo is called the permitivity of free space. In SI units, where force is in Newtons (N), distance in meters (m), and charge in coulombs (C), C2 e0 = 8.85 x 1<T12- -.. N • m2 In words, the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance. As always (Sect. 1.1.4), >i is the separation vector from r' (the location of q) to r (the location of Q): * = r - r'; (2.2) n, is its magnitude, and i is its direction. The force points along the line from q to Q\\ it is repulsive if q and Q have the same sign, and attractive if their signs are opposite. Coulomb’s law and the principle of superposition constitute the physical input for electrostatics—the rest, except for some special properties of matter, is mathematical elab¬ oration of these fundamental rules. 60 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS Problem 2.1 (a) Twelve equal charges, q, are situated at the comers of a regular 12-sided polygon (for instance, one on each numeral of a clock face). What is the net force on a test charge Q at the center? (b) Suppose one of the 12 q’s is removed (the one at “6 o’clock”). What is the force on Q1 Explain your reasoning carefully. (c) Now 13 equal charges, q, are placed at the comers of a regular 13-sided polygon. What is the force on a test charge Q at the center? (d) If one of the 13 q’s is removed, what is the force on Q!

Notice that it is a function of position (r), because the separation vectors 4, depend on the location of the field point P (Fig. 2.3). But it makes no reference to the test charge Q. The electric field is a vector quantity that varies Figure 2.3 2.1. THE ELECTRIC FIELD 61 from point to point and is determined by the configuration of source charges; physically, E(r) is the force per unit charge that would be exerted on a test charge, if you were to place one at P. What exactly is an electric field? I have deliberately begun with what you might call the “minimal” interpretation of E, as an intermediate step in the calculation of electric forces. But I encourage you to think of the field as a “real” physical entity, filling the space in the neighborhood of any electric charge. Maxwell himself came to believe that electric and magnetic fields represented actual stresses and strains in an invisible primordial jellylike “ether.” Special relativity has forced us to abandon the notion of ether, and with it Maxwell’s mechanical interpretation of electromagnetic fields. (It is even possible, though cumbersome, to formulate classical electrodynamics as an “action-at-a-distance” theory, and dispense with the field concept altogether.) I can’t tell you, then, what a field is—only how to calculate it and what it can do for you once you’ve got it. Problem 2.2 (a) Find the electric field (magnitude and direction) a distance z above the midpoint between two equal charges, q, a distance d apart (Fig. 2.4). Check that your result is consistent with what you’d expect when z » d. (b) Repeat part (a), only this time make the right-hand charge -q instead of +q.

(d) Volume charge, p Figure 2.4 Figure 2.5 2.1.4 Continuous Charge Distributions Our definition of the electric field (Eq. 2.4), assumes that the source of the field is a collection of discrete point charges r/,. If, instead, the charge is distributed continuously over some region, the sum becomes an integral (Fig. 2.5a): 1 f 1 „ E(r) = -- / -^*dq. 47reo J n.1 (2.5) 62 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS If the charge is spread out along a line (Fig. 2.5b), with charge-per-unit-length A, then dq = A dl' (where dl' is an element of length along the line); if the charge is smeared out over a surface (Fig. 2.5c), with charge-per-unit-area a, then dq = a da' (where da' is an element of area on the surface); and if the charge fills a volume (Fig. 2.5d), with charge-per-unit-volume p, then dq = pdr' (where dr1 is an element of volume): dq —> A dl' ~ a da' ~ p dr'. Thus the electric field of a line charge is for a surface charge, and for a volume charge, E(r) = E(r) = 1 / ' MO 47re0 J V 1 [ a(r') 47re0 J S 1 f p(x') 4?r e0 J V £ ' idl'; i da' (2.6) (2.7) (2.8) Equation 2.8 itself is often referred to as “Coulomb’s law,” because it is such a short step from the original (2.1), and because a volume charge is in a sense the most general and realistic case. Please note carefully the meaning of >i in these formulas. Originally, in Eq.2.4,4; stood for the vector from the source charge t/,- to the field point r. Correspondingly, in Eqs. 2.5-2.8, 4 is the vector from dq (therefore from dl', da', or dr') to the field point Example 2.1 Find the electric field a distance z above the midpoint of a straight line segment of length 2L, which carries a uniform line charge A (Fig. 2.6). Solution: It is advantageous to chop the line up into symmetrically placed pairs (at ±jc), for then the horizontal components of the two fields cancel, and the net field of the pair is dE = 2- 4ff60 A dx cos 9 z. 2 Warning: The unit vector & is not constant; its direction depends on the source point r', and hence it cannot be taken outside the integrals 2.5-2.8. In practice, you must work with Cartesian components (x, y, z are constant, and do come out), even if you use curvilinear coordinates to perform the integration. 2.1. THE ELECTRIC FIELD 63 Here cos 9 = z/'i, 'i = \\/z 2 + -*2, and x runs from 0 to L: 1 f L 2 kz 47T6Q , (z2 + *2)3/ 2 r L 2 kz X 4^«o _z2V z2 +x 2_ 0 1 2k L 4?r60 z\\/z 2 + L2 and it aims in the --direction. For points far from the line (z >> L), this result simplifies: 1 2 XL z2 which makes sense: From far away the line “looks” like a point charge q = 2XL, so the field reduces to that of point charge q/{Aneoz^)   In the limit L —>• oo, on the other hand, we obtain the field of an infinite straight wire: E = 1 2X 4;reo z or, more generally, E = 1 2k AjtdQ S where ,v is the distance from the wire.

DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF ELECTROSTATIC FIELDS 65 2.2 Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields 2.2.1 Field Lines, Flux, and Gauss’s Law In principle, we are done with the subject of electrostatics. Equation 2.8 tells us how to compute the field of a charge distribution, and Eq. 2.3 tells us what the force on a charge Q placed in this field will be. Unfortunately, as you may have discovered in working Prob. 2.7, the integrals involved in computing E can be formidable, even for reasonably simple charge distributions. Much of the rest of electrostatics is devoted to assembling a bag of tools and tricks for avoiding these integrals. It all begins with the divergence and curl of E. I shall calculate the divergence of E directly from Eq. 2.8, in Sect. 2.2.2, but first I want to show you a more qualitative, and perhaps more illuminating, intuitive approach. Let’s begin with the simplest possible case: a single point charge q, situated at the origin: E(r) = —— 4 ? . (2.10 ) 47T60 r To get a “feel” for this field, I might sketch a few representative vectors, as in Fig. 2.12a. Because the field falls off like 1/r2, the vectors get shorter as you go farther away from the origin; they always point radially outward. But there is a nicer way to represent this field, and that’s to connect up the arrows, to form field lines (Fig. 2.12b). You might think that I have thereby thrown away information about the strength of the field, which was contained in the length of the arrows. But actually I have not. The magnitude of the field is indicated by the density of the field lines: it’s strong near the center where the field lines are close together, and weak farther out, where they are relatively far apart. In truth, the field-line diagram is deceptive, when I draw it on a two-dimensional surface, for the density of lines passing through a circle of radius r is the total number divided by the circumference (n/2nr), which goes like (1/r), not (1/r2). But if you imagine the model in three dimensions (a pincushion with needles sticking out in all directions), then the density of lines is the total number divided by the area of the sphere (n/4jtr2), which does go like (1/r2). Figure 2.12 66 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS Equal but opposite charges Figure 2.13 Such diagrams are also convenient for representing more complicated fields. Of course, the number of lines you draw depends on how energetic you are (and how sharp your pencil is), though you ought to include enough to get an accurate sense of the field, and you must be consistent: If charge q gets 8 lines, then 2q deserves 16. And you must space them fairly—they emanate from a point charge symmetrically in all directions. Field lines begin on positive charges and end on negative ones; they cannot simply terminate in midair, though they may extend out to infinity. Moreover, field lines can never cross—at the intersection, the field would have two different directions at once! With all this in mind, it is easy to sketch the field of any simple configuration of point charges: Begin by drawing the lines in the neighborhood of each charge, and then connect them up or extend them to infinity (Figs. 2.13 and 2.14). Figure 2.14 2.2. DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF ELECTROSTATIC FIELDS 67 Figure 2.15 In this model the flux of E through a surface S, -t>E = j E-da, (2.11) is a measure of the “number of field lines’’ passing through <S. I put this in quotes because of course we can only draw a representative sample of the field lines—the total number would be infinite. But for a given sampling rate the flux is proportional to the number of lines drawn, because the field strength, remember, is proportional to the density of field lines (the number per unit area), and hence E • da is proportional to the number of lines passing through the infinitesimal area da. (The dot product picks out the component of da along the direction of E, as indicated in Fig. 2.15. It is only the area in the plane perpendicular to E that we have in mind when we say that the density of field lines is the number per unit area.) This suggests that the flux through any closed surface is a measure of the total charge inside. For the field lines that originate on a positive charge must either pass out through the surface or else terminate on a negative charge inside (Fig. 2.16a). On the other hand, a charge outside the surface will contribute nothing to the total flux, since its field lines pass in one side and out the other (Fig. 2.16b). This is the essence of Gauss’s law. Now let’s make it quantitative. <7 (a) (b) Figure 2.16 68 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS In the case of a point charge q at the origin, the flux of E through a sphere of radius r is E • da    [ --• (r2 sin 6 dd d(p r) = —q. (2.12) J 47T60 / 60 Notice that the radius of the sphere cancels out, for while the surface area goes up as r2, the field goes down as 1/r2, and so the product is constant. In terms of the field-line picture, this makes good sense, since the same number of field lines passes through any sphere centered at the origin, regardless of its size. In fact, it didn’t have to be a sphere—any closed surface, whatever its shape, would trap the same number of field lines. Evidently the flux through any surface enclosing the charge is q/eo- Now suppose that instead of a single charge at the origin, we have a bunch of charges scattered about. According to the principle of superposition, the total field is the (vector) sum of all the individual fields: n E = I>- i=i The flux through a surface that encloses them all, then, is / E^ a = E(/E'^a) = E For any closed surface, then, (2.13) where Qenc is the total charge enclosed within the surface. This is the quantitative state¬ ment of Gauss’s law. Although it contains no information that was not already present in Coulomb’s law and the principle of superposition, it is of almost magical power, as you will see in Sect. 2.2.3. Notice that it all hinges on the 1 /r 2 character of Coulomb’s law; without that the crucial cancellation of the r’s in Eq. 2.12 would not take place, and the total flux of E would depend on the surface chosen, not merely on the total charge enclosed. Other 1/r2 forces (I am thinking particularly of Newton’s law of universal gravitation) will obey “Gauss’s laws” of their own, and the applications we develop here carry over directly. As it stands, Gauss’s law is an integral equation, but we can readily turn it into a differential one, by applying the divergence theorem: E • da s j (V • E) dr. v Rewriting gene in terms of the charge density p, we have Q enc / pdr. V 2.2. DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF ELECTROSTATIC FIELDS 69 So Gauss’s law becomes v v dr. And since this holds for any volume, the integrands must be equal: V E = 1 — P- eo (2.14) Equation 2.14 carries the same message as Eq. 2.13; it is Gauss’s law in differential form. The differential version is tidier, but the integral form has the advantage in that it accommodates point, line, and surface charges more naturally. Problem 2.9 Suppose the electric field in some region is found to be E = fcr3?, in spherical coordinates (k is some constant). (a) Find the charge density p. (b) Find the total charge contained in a sphere of radius R, centered at the origin. (Do it two different ways.) Problem 2.10 A charge q sits at the back comer of a cube, as shown in Fig. 2.17. What is the flux of E through the shaded side? 2.2.2 The Divergence of E Let’s go back, now, and calculate the divergence of E directly from Eq. 2.8: E<r) = i / <2I5) all space (Originally the integration was over the volume occupied by the charge, but I may as well extend it to all space, since p = 0 in the exterior region anyway.) Noting that the 70 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS r-dependence is contained in n. = r — r', we have VE = 4^/ V -( ?) <,<r',‘,t'- This is precisely the divergence we calculated in Eq. 1.100: V K = 4ttS». Thus V -E = 1 4^60 / 47Ti53(r v')p(r')dx' 1 —/o(r), eo (2.16) which is Gauss’s law in differential form (2.14). To recover the integral form (2.13), we run the previous argument in reverse—integrate over a volume and apply the divergence theorem: / V -Edx = S E • da 1 eo 1 eo Gene- 2.2.3 Applications of Gauss’s Law I must interrupt the theoretical development at this point to show you the extraordinary power of Gauss’s law, in integral form. When symmetry permits, it affords by far the quickest and easiest way of computing electric fields. I’ll illustrate the method with a series of examples. Example 2.2 Find the field outside a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and total charge q. Solution: Draw a spherical surface at radius r > R (Fig. 2.18); this is called a “Gaussian surface’’ in the trade. Gauss’s law says that for this surface (as for any other) E   da — — Qenc   eo and Qenc = q. At first glance this doesn’t seem to get us very far, because the quantity we want (E) is buried inside the surface integral. Luckily, symmetry allows us to extract E from under the integral sign: E certainly points radially outward,3 as does da, so we can drop the dot product, jE-da S j |E| da, S 3If you doubt that E is radial, consider the alternative. Suppose, say, that it points due east, at the “equator.” But the orientation of the equator is perfectly arbitrary—nothing is spinning here, so there is no natural “north-south” axis—any argument purporting to show that E points east could just as well be used to show it points west, or north, or any other direction. The only unique direction on a sphere is radial. 2.2. DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF ELECTROSTATIC FIELDS 71 Gaussian surface Figure 2.18 and the magnitude of E is constant over the Gaussian surface, so it comes outside the integral: / |E| da = |E| / da = |E| 4nr 2. Thus or |E|4 nr 2 1 <?0 E = 1 q . 4jreo r 2 Notice a remarkable feature of this result: The field outside the sphere is exactly the same as it would have been if all the charge had been concentrated at the center. Gauss’s law is always true, but it is not always useful. If p had not been uniform (or, at any rate, not spherically symmetrical), or if I had chosen some other shape for my Gaussian surface, it would still have been true that the flux of E is (1/eo)q, but I would not have been certain that E was in the same direction as da and constant in magnitude over the surface, and without thdt I could not pull |E| out of the integral. Symmetry is crucial to this application of Gauss’s law. As far as I know, there are only three kinds of symmetry that work: 1. Spherical symmetry. Make your Gaussian surface a concentric sphere. 2. Cylindrical symmetry. Make your Gaussian surface a coaxial cylinder (Fig. 2.19). 3. Plane symmetry. Use a Gaussian “pillbox,” which straddles the surface (Fig. 2.20). Although (2) and (3) technically require infinitely long cylinders, and planes extending to infinity in all directions, we shall often use them to get approximate answers for “long” cylinders or “large” plane surfaces, at points far from the edges. 72 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS Example 2.3 A long cylinder (Fig. 2.21) carries a charge density that is proportional to the distance from the axis: p = ks, for some constant k. Find the electric field inside this cylinder. Solution: Draw a Gaussian cylinder of length l and radius 5. For this surface, Gauss’s law states: E-da = — 2enc- ^0 The enclosed charge is Qenc = J pdr = J (ks')(s'ds'd(f> dz) = 2nkl J s'2 ds' = |jt kls^. (I used the volume element appropriate to cylindrical coordinates, Eq. 1.78, and integrated (f> from 0 to 2tc, dz from 0 to /. I put a prime on the integration variable s', to distinguish it from the radius 5 of the Gaussian surface.) ! Figure 2.21 22. DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF ELECTROSTATIC FIELDS 73 Now, symmetry dictates that E must point radially outward, so for the curved portion of the Gaussian cylinder we have: j E • da = J |E| da = |E| j da = |E| 2nsl, while the two ends contribute nothing (here E is perpendicular to da). Thus, 1 2 ^ |E| 2nsl =- n k lsi . e0 3 or, finally, 1 E = -—ks 3g() Example 2.4 An infinite plane carries a uniform surface charge a. Find its electric field. Solution: Draw a “Gaussian pillbox,” extending equal distances above and below the plane (Fig. 2.22). Apply Gauss’s law to this surface: S E • da — 2enc • / e0 In this case, Qenc = & A, where A is the area of the lid of the pillbox. By symmetry, E points away from the plane (upward for points above, downward for points below). Thus, the top and bottom surfaces yield J E   da = 2A|E|, Figure 2.22 74 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS whereas the sides contribute nothing. Thus 2A |E| 1 —a A, eo or (2.17) where n is a unit vector pointing away from the surface. In Prob. 2.6, you obtained this same result by a much more laborious method. It seems surprising, at first, thaf the field of an infinite plane is independent of how far away you are. What about the 1 /r 2 in Coulomb’s law? Well, the point is that as you move farther and farther away from the plane, more and more charge comes into your “field of view” (a cone shape extending out from your eye), and this compensates for the diminishing influence of any particular piece. The electric field of a sphere falls off like 1/r2; the electric field of an infinite line falls off like 1/r; and the electric field of an infinite plane does not fall off at all. Although the direct u$e of Gauss’s law to compute electric fields is limited to cases of spherical, cylindrical, and planar symmetry, we can put together combinations of objects possessing such symmetry, even though the arrangement as a whole is not symmetrical. For example, invoking the principle of superposition, we could find the field in the vicinity of two uniformly charged parallel cylinders, or a sphere near an infinite charged plane. Example 2.5 Two infinite parallel planes carry equal hut opposite uniform charge densities ±<r (Fig. 2.23). Find the field in each of the three regions: (ij to the left of both, (ii) between them, (iii) to the right of both. Solution: The left plate produces a field (l/2eo)ff which points away from it (Fig. 2.24)—to the left in region (i) and to the right in regions (ii) and (iii). The right plate, being negatively charged, produces a field (l/2eo)p', which points toward it—to the right in regions (i) and (ii) and to the left in region (iii). The two fields cancel in regions (i) and (iii); they conspire in region (ii). Conclusion: The field is (1 /cq)o, and points to the right, between the planes; elsewhere it is zero.

Problem 2.13 Find the electric field a distance s from an infinitely long straight wire, which carries a uniform line charge A. Compare Eq. 2.9. Problem 2.14 Find the electric field inside a sphere which carries a charge density proportional to the distance from the origin, p = kr, for some constant k. [Hint: This charge density is not uniform, and you must integrate to get the enclosed charge.] Problem 2.15 A hollow spherical shell carries charge density k P= ~2 in the region a < r < b (Fig. 2.25). Find the electric field in the three regions: (i) r < a, (ii) a < r < b, (iii) r > b. Plot |E| as a function of r. Problem 2.16 A long coaxial cable (Fig. 2.26) carries a uniform volume charge density p on the inner cylinder (radius a), and a uniform surface charge density on the outer cylindrical shell (radius b). This surface charge is negative and of just the right magnitude so that the cable as a whole is electrically neutral. Find the electric field in each of the three regions: (i) inside the inner cylinder (s < a), (ii) between the cylinders (a < s < b), (iii) outside the cable (s > b). Plot |E| as a function of s. Problem 2.17 An infinite plane slab, of thickness 2d, carries a uniform volume charge density p (Fig. 2.27). Find the electric field, as a function of y, where y = 0 at the center. Plot E versus y, calling E positive when it points in the +y direction and negative when it points in the —y direction. Problem 2.18 Two spheres, each of radius R and carrying uniform charge densities +p and —p, respectively, are placed so that they partially overlap (Fig. 2.28). Call the vector from the positive center to the negative center d. Show that the field in the region of overlap is constant, and find its value. [Hint: Use the answer to Prob. 2.12.] Figure 2.25 Figure 2.26 2.2.4 The Curl of E I’ll calculate the curl of E, as I did the divergence in Sect. 2.2.1, by studying first the simplest possible configuration: a point charge at the origin. In this case E = 1 g > 4;reo r2 Now, a glance at Fig. 2.12 should convince you that the curl of this field has to be zero, but I suppose we ought to come up with something a little more rigorous than that. What if we calculate the line integral of this field from some point a to some other point b (Fig. 2.29): b E-dl. In spherical coordinates, d\\ = dr r + r dd 6 + r sin 0 d(f> <j>, so E-c/l = 1 Therefore, [ E-dl= —- [ ^dr = Ja 4jre0 Ja r 4k€q r2 -1 q 4tt r dr. n 43re0 \\r a q_ n (2.18) where ra is the distance from the origin to the point a and r/, is the distance to b. The integral around a closed path is evidently zero (for then ra = r/,): E • dl = 0, (2.19) 2.3. ELECTRIC POTENTIAL 11 and hence, applying Stokes’ theorem, V x E = 0. (2.20) Now, I proved Eqs. 2.19 and 2.20 only for the held of a single point charge at the origin, but these results make no reference to what is, after all, a perfectly arbitrary choice of coordinates; they also hold no matter where the charge is located. Moreover, if we have many charges, the principle of superposition states that the total held is a vector sum of their individual helds: E = E] + E2 + ..., so V x E = V x (E] + E2 + ...) = (V x Ei) + (V x E2) + ... = 0. Thus, Eqs. 2.19 and 2.20 hold for any static charge distribution whatever. Problem 2.19 Calculate V x E directly from Eq. 2.8, by the method of Sect. 2.2.2. Refer to Prob. 1.62 if you get stuck. 2 J Electric Potential 2.3.1 Introduction to Potential The electric held E is not just any old vector function; it is a very special kind of vector function, one whose curl is always zero. E = yx, for example, could not possibly be an electrostatic held; no set of charges, regardless of their sizes and positions, could ever produce such a held. In this section we’re going to exploit this special property of electric helds to reduce a vector problem (hnding E) down to a much simpler scalar problem. The hrst theorem in Sect. 1.6.2 asserts that any vector whose curl is zero is equal to the gradient of some scalar. What I’m going to do now amounts to a proof of that claim, in the context of electrostatics. 78 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS b a (ii) Figure 2.30 Because V x E = 0, the line integral of E around any closed loop is zero (that follows from Stokes’ theorem). Because § E • dl = 0, the line integral of E from point a to point b is the same for all paths (otherwise you could go out along path (i) and return along path (ii)—Fig. 2.30—and obtain E • dl ^ 0). Because the line integral is independent of path, we can define a function4 V(r) = - E • dl. (2.21) Here O is some standard reference point on which we have agreed beforehand; V then depends only on the point r. It is called the electric potential. Evidently, the potential difference between two points a and b is V (b) - V (a) E-dl + E- dl- (2.22) Now, the fundamental theorem for gradients states that V(b) - V(a) = f (VV) - dl, so (VV) dl = E   dl. Since, finally, this is true for any points a and b, the integrands must be equal: E = -VV. (2.23) Equation 2.23 is the differential version of Eq. 2.21; it says that the electric field is the gradient of a scalar potential, which is what we set out to prove. 4To avoid any possible ambiguity I should perhaps put a prime on the integration variable: V(r) = - f E(r')   d\\'. Jo But this makes for cumbersome notation, and I prefer whenever possible to reserve the primes for source points. However, when (as in Ex. 2.6) we calculate such integrals explicitly, I shall put in the primes. 2.3. ELECTRIC POTENTIAL 79 Notice the subtle but crucial role played by path independence (or, equivalently, the fact that V x E = 0) in this argument. If the line integral of E depended on the path taken, then the “definition” of V, Eq. 2.21, would be nonsense. It simply would not define a function, since changing the path would alter the value of V(r). By the way, don’t let the minus sign in Eq. 2.23 distract you; it carries over from 2.21 and is largely a matter of convention. Problem 2.20 One of these is an impossible electrostatic field. Which one? (a) E = k[xy x + 2yz y + 3xz z]; (b) E = k[y2 x + (2xy + z2) y + 2yz z]. Here k is a constant with the appropriate units. For the possible one, find the potential, using the origin as your reference point. Check your answer by computing VV, [Hint: You must select a specific path to integrate along. It doesn’t matter what path you choose, since the answer is path-independent, but you simply cannot integrate unless you have a particular path in mind.l 2.3.2 Comments on Potential (i) The i)pme. The word “potential” is a hideous misnomer because it inevitably reminds you of potential energy. This is particularly confusing, because there is a connection between “potential” and “potential energy,” as you will see in Sect. 2.4. I’m sorry that it is impossible to escape this word. The best I can do is to insist once and for all that “potential” and “potential energy” are completely different terms and should, by all rights, have different names. Incidentally, a surface over which the potential is constant is called an equipotential. (ii) Advantage of the potential formulation. If you know V, you can easily get E—just take the gradient: E = — V V. This is quite extraordinary when you stop to think about it, for E is a vector quantity (three components), but V is a scalar (one component). How can one function possibly contain all the information that three independent functions carry? The answer is that the three components of E are not really as independent as they look; in fact, they are explicitly interrelated by the very condition we started with, V x E = 0. In terms of components, dE±_ B E 1 dEz _ dEy dEx _ dEz dy dx 3y 3z ’ 3Z dx This brings us back to my observation at the beginning of Sect. 2.3.1: E is a very special kind of vector. What the potential formulation does is to exploit this feature to maximum advantage, reducing a vector problem down to a scalar one, in which there is no need to fuss with components. 80 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS (iii) The reference point O. There is an essential ambiguity in the definition of potential, since the choice of reference point O was arbitrary. Changing reference points amounts to adding a constant K to the potential: /*r pO pr V'(r) = - Edl = - E c/1 — / E • d\\ = K + V(r), JO' JO' JO where K is the line integral of E from the old reference point O to the new one O'. Of course, adding a constant to V will not affect the potential difference between two points: V\\b) - V'(a) = V(b) - V(a), since the K’s cancel out. (Actually, it was already clear from Eq. 2.22 that the potential difference is independent of O, because it can be written as the line integral of E from a to b, with no reference to O.) Nor does the ambiguity affect the gradient of V: vv' = vv, since the derivative of a constant is zero. That’s why all such V’s, differing only in their choice of reference point, correspond to the same field E. Evidently potential as such carries no real physical significance, for at any given point we can adjust its value at will by a suitable relocation of O. In this sense it is rather like altitude: If I ask you how high Denver is, you will probably tell me its height above sea level, because that is a convenient and traditional reference point. But we could as well agree to measure altitude above Washington D.C., or Greenwich, or wherever. That would add (or, rather, subtract) a fixed amount from all our sea-level readings, but it wouldn’t change anything about the real world. The only quantity of intrinsic interest is the difference in altitude between two points, and that is the same whatever your reference level. Having said this, however, there is a “natural” spot to use for O in electrostatics— analogous to sea level for altitude—and that is a point infinitely far from the charge. Or¬ dinarily, then, we “set the zero of potential at infinity.” (Since V(0) = 0, choosing a reference point is equivalent to selecting a place where V is to be zero.) But I must warn you that there is one special circumstance in which this convention fails: when the charge distribution itself extends to infinity. The symptom of trouble, in such cases, is that the potential blows up. For instance, the field of a uniformly charged plane is (a/2eo)n, as we found in Ex. 2.4; if we naively put O = oo, then the potential at height r above the plane becomes fz 1 1 V(z) = -I -—adz = -- —a {z - oo). Joo 2eo 2eo The remedy is simply to choose some other reference point (in this problem you might use the origin). Notice that the difficulty occurs only in textbook problems; in “real life” there is no such thing as a charge distribution that goes on forever, and we can always use infinity as our reference point. 2.3, ELECTRIC POTENTIAL 81 (iv) Potential obeys the superposition principle. The original superposition princi¬ ple of electrodynamics pertains to the force on a test charge Q. It says that the total force on Q is the vector sum of the forces attributable to the source charges individually: F = Ft + F2 + ... Dividing through by Q,we find that the electric field, too, obeys the superposition principle: E = Ei ~J- E2 + ... Integrating from the common reference point to r, it follows that the potential also satisfies such a principle: V — V\\ + V2 + •.. That is, the potential at any given point is the sum of the potentials due to all the source charges separately. Only this time it is an ordinary sum, not a vector sum, which makes it a lot easier to work with. (v) Units of Potential. In our units, force is measured in newtons and charge in coulombs, so electric fields are in newtons per coulomb. Accordingly, potential is measured in newton-meters per coulomb or joules per coulomb. A joule per coulomb is called a volt. Example 2.6 Find the potential inside and outside a spherical shell of radius R (Fig. 2.31), which carries a uniform surface charge. Set the reference point at infinity. Figure 2.31 82 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS Solution: From Gauss’s law, the field outside is 4jt€q r2 where q is the total charge on the sphere. The field inside is zero. For points outside the sphere (r > R), V(r) = - (\\-d\\ = —^- f 4 JO 4tt€0 Jco r'- dr' = 4jt€q r' 1 q 47T€o r To find the potential inside the sphere (r < R), we must break the integral into two sections, using in each region the field that prevails there: V(0 = Y~~f “7?dr'~f (°)dr' 4xeo J co r 2 Jr 1 q 4neo r' + 0 = <1 Alt 6q R Notice that the potential is not zero inside the shell, even though the field is. V is a constant in this region, to be sure, so that VP = 0—that’s what matters. In problems of this type you must always work your way in from the reference point; that’s where the potential is “nailed down.’’ It is tempting to suppose that you could figure out the potential inside the sphere on the basis of the field there alone, but this is false: The potential inside the sphere is sensitive to what’s going on outside the sphere as well. If I placed a second uniformly charged shell out at radius R' > R, the potential inside R would change, even though the field would still be zero. Gauss’s law guarantees that charge exterior to a given point (that is, at larger r) produces no net field at that point, provided it is spherically or'cylindrically symmetric; but there is no such rule for potential, when infinity is used as the reference point. Problem 2.21 Find the potential inside and outside a uniformly charged solid sphere whose radius is R and whose total charge is q. Use infinity as your reference point. Compute the gradient of V in each region, and check that it yields the correct field. Sketch V (r). Problem 2.22 Find the potential a distance s from an infinitely long straight wire that carries a uniform line charge X. Compute the gradient of your potential, and check that it yields the correct field. Problem 2.23 For the charge configuration of Prob. 2.15, find the potential at the center, using infinity as your reference point. Problem 2.24 For the configuration of Prob. 2.16, find the potential difference between a point on the axis and a point on the outer cylinder. Note that it is not necessary to commit yourself to a particular reference point if you use Eq. 2.22. 2.3. ELECTRIC POTENTIAL 83 2.3.3 Poisson’s Equation and Laplace’s Equation We found in Sect. 2.3.1 that the electric held can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential. E = —VP. The question arises: What do the fundamental equations for E, V • E = — and V x E = 0, co look like, in terms of V? Well, V • E = V • (—V V) = — V2 V, so, apart from that persisting minus sign, the divergence of E is the Laplacian of V. Gauss’s law then says that V 2V = - —. co (2.24) This is known as Poisson’s equation. In regions where there is no charge, so that p = 0, Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation, v2v = 0. (2.25) We’ll explore these equations more fully in Chapter 3. So much for Gauss’s law. What about the curl law? This says that V x E = V x (—V V) must equal zero. But that’s no condition on V—curl of gradient is always zero. Of course, we used the curl law to show that E could be expressed as the gradient of a scalar, so it’s not really surprising that this works out: V x E = 0p ermits E = -V V; in return, E = -V V guarantees V x E = 0. It takes only one differential equation (Poisson’s) to determine V, because V is a scalar; for E we needed two, the divergence and the curl. 2.3.4 The Potential of a Localized Charge Distribution I defined V in terms of E (Eq. 2.21). Ordinarily, though, it’s E that we’re looking for (if we already knew E there wouldn’t be much point in calculating V). The idea is that it might be easier to get V first, and then calculate E by taking the gradient. Typically, then, we know where the charge is (that is, we know p), and we want to find V. Now, Poisson’s equation relates V and p, but unfortunately it’s “the wrong way around”: it would give us p. if we knew V, whereas we want V, knowing p. What we must do, then, is “invert” Poisson’s equation. That’s the program for this section, although I shall do it by roundabout means, beginning, as always, with a point charge at the origin. 84 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS Figure 2.32 Setting the reference point at infinity, the potential of a point charge q at the origin is 1 g 4rreo r' (You see here the special virtue of using infinity for the reference point: it kills the lower limit on the integral.) Notice the sign of V; presumably the conventional minus sign in the definition of V (Eq. 2.21) was chosen precisely in order to make the potential of a positive charge come out positive. It is useful to remember that regions of positive charge are potential “hills,” regions of negative charge are potential “valleys,” and the electric field points “downhill,” from plus toward minus. In general, the potential of a point charge q is V(r) = -1 4ne0 f Cvd r' 1 q 4yt€o r' V (r) = 1 q 4lC€0 4 (2.26) where n,, as always, is the distance from the charge to r (Fig. 2.32). Invoking the superpo¬ sition principle, then, the potential of a collection of charges is V (r) 1 £ <h_ 4jT £o ; = ] 4j or, for a continuous distribution, V(r) = (2.27) (2.28) In particular, for a volume charge, it’s V(r) = (2.29) This is the equation we were looking for, telling us how to compute V when we know p; it is, if you like, the “solution” to Poisson’s equation, for a localized charge distribution.5 I Equation 2.29 is an example of the Helmholtz theorem (Appendix B), in the context of electrostatics, where the curl of E is zero and its divergence is p/eq. 2.3. ELECTRIC POTENTIAL 85 invite you to compare Eq. 2.29 with the corresponding formula for the electric field in terms of p (Eq. 2.8): E(r) = / The main point to notice is that the pesky unit vector i is now missing, so there is no need to worry about components. Incidentally, the potentials of line and surface charges are 1 47T€0 / and (2.30) I should warn you that everything in this section is predicated on the assumption that the reference point is at infinity. This is hardly apparent in Eq. 2.29, but remember that we got that equation from the potential of a point charge at the origin, (1/4 7t€0)(q/r), which is valid only when O = oo. If you try to apply these formulas to one of those artificial problems in which the charge itself extends to infinity, the integral will diverge. Example 2.7 Find the potential of a uniformly charged spherical shell of radius R (Fig. 2.33). Solution: This is the same problem we solved in Ex. 2.6, but this time we shall do it using Eq. 2.30: V(r) = —( 4lt 6Q J   da'. Let s set the point r on the z axis and use the law of cosines to express 4 in terms of the polar angle 9: C 1 = R2 + Z2 - 2Rz cos O'. Figure 2.33 86 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS An element of surface area on this sphere is R2 sin 9' d9' dtp', so 4jt60 V(z) J = 2ttR z<j R2 sin 9' d9' dtp' 'Jr 2 + z2 - 2Rz cos 9' f 71 sind' JO Jr 2 + z2 -2Rzcos9' d9' = 2jtR 2a 2Rz cos 9' n 0 = (V R 2 + z2 + 2Rz - 'Jr 2 +z 2 - 2Rz ) = 2^~ |V(fl + z)2 - V(R - Z)2 ]   At this stage we must be very careful to take the positive root. For points outside the sphere, z is greater than R, and hence sJ(R — z)2 = z — R', forpoints inside the sphere, v(/? — z)2 = R— z. Thus, Ra R2a V(z) = --[(/? + z) - (z -/?)] = -, outside; 2e0z e0z Ra Ra V(z) = --[(/? + z) - (/? - z)] =—, inside. 2e0z 60 In terms of the total charge on the shell, q = 4nR 2a, V( z) = (l/4jreo)(<?/z) (or, in general, V(r) = (1/ 47T60){q/r)) forpoints outside the sphere, and (\\/47teo)(q/R) forpoints inside. Of course, in this particular case, it was easier to get V by using 2.21 than 2.30, because Gauss’s law gave us E with so little effort. But if you compare Ex. 2.7 with Prob. 2.7, you will appreciate the power of the potential formulation. Problem 2.25 Using Eqs. 2.27 and 2.30, find the potential at a distance z above the center of the charge distributions in Fig. 2.34. In each case, compute E = —VF, and compare your answers with Prob. 2.2a, Ex. 2.1, and Prob. 2.6, respectively. Suppose that we changed the right-hand charge in Fig. 2.34a to —q; what then is the potential at PI What field does that suggest?

Find the potential difference between points a (the vertex) and b (the center of the top). Problem 2.27 Find the potential on the axis of a uniformly charged solid cylinder, a distance z from the center. The length of the cylinder is L, its radius is R, and the charge density is p. Use your result to calculate the electric field at this point. (Assume that z > L/2.) Problem 2.28 Use Eq. 2.29 to calculate the potential inside a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and total charge q. Compare your answer to Prob. 2.21. Problem 2.29 Check that Eq. 2.29 satisfies Poisson’s equation, by applying the Laplacian and using Eq. 1.102. 2.3.5 Summary; Electrostatic Boundary Conditions In the typical electrostatic problem you are given a source charge distribution p, and you want to find the electric field E it produces. Unless the symmetry of the problem admits a solution by Gauss’s law, it is generally to your advantage to calculate the potential first, as an intermediate step. These, then, are the three fundamental quantities of electrostatics: p, E, and V. We have, in the course of our discussion, derived all six formulas interrelating them. These equations are neatly summarized in Fig. 2.35. We began with just two exper¬ imental observations: (1) the principle of superposition—a broad general rule applying to all electromagnetic forces, and (2) Coulomb’s law—the fundamental law of electrostatics. From these, all else followed. Figure 2.35 88 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS You may have noticed, in studying Exs. 2.4 and 2.5, or working problems such as 2.7, 2.11, and 2.16, that the electric held always undergoes a discontinuity when you cross a surface charge a. In fact, it is a simple matter to find the amount by which E changes at such a boundary. Suppose we draw a wafer-thin Gaussian pillbox, extending just barely over the edge in each direction (Fig. 2.36). Gauss’s law states that (& E • d a = Q enc = tr A, J <?0 60 5 where A is the area of the pillbox lid. (If a varies from point to point or the surface is curved, we must pick A to be extremely small.) Now, the sides of the pillbox contribute nothing to the flux, in the limit as the thickness e goes to zero, so we are left with £ atove - £ below = ^ a ’ <2 '31) <?0 where denotes the component of E that is perpendicular to the surface immediately above, and £^ low is the same, only just below the surface. For consistency, we let “upward” be the positive direction for both. Conclusion: The normal component of E is discontinuous by an amount a/eo at any boundary. In particular, where there is no surface charge, E1 is continuous, as for instance at the surface of a uniformly charged solid sphere. The tangential component of E, by contrast, is always continuous. For if we apply Eq. 2.19, E   dl = 0, to the thin rectangular loop of Fig. 2.37, the ends give nothing (as 6 ->   0), and the sides 8ive (£ above/ ^below /), so 17 II _ 17 II ^above ^below’ (2.32) 2.3. ELECTRIC POTENTIAL 89 Figure 2.37 where stands for the components of Ep arallel to the surface.

Incidentally, if you’re only interested in the field due to the (essentially flat) local patch of surface charge itself the answer is (<r/2e0)n immediately above the surface, and -(<r/2e 0)n immediately below. This follows from Ex. 2.4, for if you are close enough to the patch it “looks” like an infinite plane. Evidently the entire discontinuity in E is attributable to this local patch of charge. 90 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS However, the gradient of V inherits the discontinuity in E; since E = — W, Eq. 2.33 implies that or, more conveniently, ^i^above ^^below — <rh, <?0 9 Eabove 9 Fbelow dn dn 1 — O', <?0 (2.35) (2.36) where dV — = VV n dn (2.37) denotes the normal derivative of V (that is, the rate of change in the direction perpendicular to the surface). Please note that these boundary conditions relate the fields and potentials just above and just below the surface. For example, the derivatives in Eq. 2.36 are the limiting values as we approach the surface from either side. Problem 2.30 (a) Check that the results of Exs. 2.4 and 2.5, and Prob. 2.11, are consistent with Eq. 2.33. (b) Use Gauss’s law to find the field inside and outside a long hollow cylindrical tube, which carries a uniform surface charge a. Check that your result is consistent with Eq. 2.33.

Question: How much work will you have to do? At any point along the path, the electric force on Q is F = QE; the force you must exert, in opposition to this electrical force, is — QE. (If the sign bothers you, think about lifting a brick: Gravity exerts a force mg downward, but you exert a force mg upward.

The work is therefore /b pb F   dl = -Q / E • d\\ = Q[V(b) - V(a)]. J a Notice that the answer is independent of the path you take from a to b; in mechanics, then, we would call the electrostatic force “conservative.” Dividing through by Q, we have V(b)-V(a) = ^. (2.38) In words, the potential difference between points a and b is equal to the work per unit charge required to carry a particle from a to b. In particular, if you want to bring the charge Q in from far away and stick it at point r, the work you must do is W = Q[V(r) - V( oo)], so, if you have set the reference point at infinity, W=QV( r). (2.39) In this sense potential is potential energy (the work it takes to create the system) per unit charge (just as the field is the force per unit charge). 2.4.2 The Energy of a Point Charge Distribution How much work would it take to assemble an entire collection of point charges? Imagine bringing in the charges, one by one, from far away (Fig. 2.40). The first charge, q\\, takes no work, since there is no held yet to fight against. Now bring in q2.

A nicer way to accomplish the same purpose is intentionally to count each pair twice, and then divide by 2 : W = EE^ 8;reo j=i (2.41) (we must still avoid i = /, of course). Notice that in this form the answer plainly does not depend on the order in which you assemble the charges, since every pair occurs in the sum.

(2.43) (The corresponding integrals for line and surface charges would be f XV dl and f aV da, respectively.) There is a lovely way to rewrite this result, in which p and V are eliminated in favor of E. First use Gauss’s law to express p in terms of E: p = e0V   E, so J ( V -E)Vdr. Now use integration by parts (Eq. 1.59) to transfer the derivative from E to V: j E-(VV)dr + VE • da But W = —E, so (2.44) 94 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS But what volume is this we’re integrating over? Let’s go back to the formula we started with, Eq. 2.43. From its derivation, it is clear that we should integrate over the region where the charge is located. But actually, any larger volume would do just as well: The “extra” territory we throw in will contribute nothing to the integral anyway, since p = 0 out there. With this in mind, let’s return to Eq. 2.44. What happens here, as we enlarge the volume beyond the minimum necessary to trap all the charge? Well, the integral of E 2 can only increase (the integrand being positive); evidently the surface integral must decrease correspondingly to leave the sum intact. In fact, at large distances from the charge, E goes like 1/r2 and V like 1/r, while the surface area grows like r2. Roughly speaking, then, the surface integral goes down like 1/r. Please understand that Eq. 2.44 gives you the correct energy W, whatever volume you use (as long as it encloses all the charge), but the contribution from the volume integral goes up, and that of the surface integral goes down, as you take larger and larger volumes. In particular, why not integrate over all space? Then the surface integral goes to zero, and we are left with W=j j E 2d r. all space (2.45) Example 2.8 Find the energy of a uniformly charged spherical shell of total charge q and radius R.

Problem 2.33 Here is a fourth way of computing the energy of a uniformly charged sphere: Assemble the sphere layer by layer, each time bringing in an infinitesimal charge dq from far away and smearing it uniformly over the surface, thereby increasing the radius. How much work dW does it take to build up the radius by an amount dr? Integrate this to find the work necessary to create the entire sphere of radius R and total charge q. 2.4.4 Comments on Electrostatic Energy (i) A perplexing “inconsistency.” Equation 2.45 clearly implies that the energy of a stationary charge distribution is always positive. On the other hand, Eq. 2.42 (from which 2.45 was in fact derived), can be positive or negative. For instance, according to 2.42, the energy of two equal but opposite charges a distance 4 apart would be —(1 /47reo)(<?2/^)- What’s gone wrong? Which equation is correct? The answer is that both equations are correct, but they pertain to slightly different situations. Equation 2.42 does not take into account the work necessary to make the point charges in the first place; we started with point charges and simply found the work required to bring them together. This is wise policy, since Eq. 2.45 indicates that the energy of a point charge is in fact infinite: W = eo f /V 2(47re0)2 J V 4 (r2 si Ad dr dO dip) q2 f°° 87T60 Jo 1 — dr = oo. rz Equation 2.45 is more complete, in the sense that it tells you the total energy stored in a charge configuration, but Eq. 2.42 is more appropriate when you’re dealing with point charges, because we prefer (for good reason!) to leave out that portion of the total energy that is attributable to the fabrication of the point charges themselves. In practice, after all, the point charges (electrons, say) are given to us ready-made; all we do is move them around. Since we did not put them together, and we cannot take them apart, it is immaterial how much work the process would involve. (Still, the infinite energy of a point charge is a recurring source of embarrassment for electromagnetic theory, afflicting the quantum version as well as the classical. We shall return to the problem in Chapter 11.) Now, you may wonder where the inconsistency crept into an apparently water-tight derivation. The “flaw” lies between Eqs. 2.42 and 2.43: In the former, U(r,) represents the potential due to all the other charges but not q,. whereas in the latter, V (r) is the full potential. For a continuous distribution there is no distinction, since the amount of charge right at the point r is vanishingly small, and its contribution to the potential is zero. 96 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS (ii) Where is the energy stored? Equations 2.43 and 2.45 offer two different ways of calculating the same thing. The first is an integral over the charge distribution; the second is an integral over the field. These can involve completely different regions. For instance, in the case of the spherical shell (Ex. 2.8) the charge is confined to the surface, whereas the electric field is present everywhere outside this surface. Where is the energy, then? Is it stored in the field, as Eq. 2.45 seems to suggest, or is it stored in the charge, as Eq. 2.43 implies? At the present level, this is simply an unanswerable question: I can tell you what the total energy is, and I can provide you with several different ways to compute it, but it is unnecessary to worry about where the energy is located. In the context of radiation theory (Chapter 11) it is useful (and in General Relativity it is essential) to regard the energy as being stored in the field, with a density £o 2 E 2 energy per unit volume. (2.46) But in electrostatics one could just as well say it is stored in the charge, with a density \\pV. The difference is purely a matter of bookkeeping. (iii) The superposition principle. Because electrostatic energy is quadratic in the fields, it does not obey a superposition principle. The energy of a compound system is not the sum of the energies of its parts considered separately—there are also “cross terms”: Wtot = f/ £2dT = J / (£ l + E 2)2 dr = ^ j(E 2 + E 2 + 2E]- E 2)dz = Wi + W2 + e0 j E] • E 2 dr. (2.47) For example, if you double the charge everywhere, you quadruple the total energy. Problem 2.34 Consider two concentric spherical shells, of radii a and h. Suppose the inner one carries a charge q, and the outer one a charge — q (both of them uniformly distributed over the surface). Calculate the energy of this configuration, (a) using Eq. 2.45, and (b) using Eq. 2.47 and the results of Ex. 2.8. 2.5 Conductors 2.5.1 Basic Properties In an insulator, such as glass or rubber, each electron is attached to a particular atom. In a metallic conductor, by contrast, one or more electrons per atom are free to roam about at will through the material. (In liquid conductors such as salt water it is ions that do the moving.) A perfect conductor would be a material containing an unlimited supply of completely free 2.5. CONDUCTORS 97 charges. In real life there are no perfect conductors, but many substances come amazingly close. From this definition the basic electrostatic properties of ideal conductors immediately follow: (i) E = 0 inside a conductor. Why? Because if there were any field, those free charges would move, and it wouldn’t be electro statics any more. Well... that’s hardly a satisfactory explanation; maybe all it proves is that you can’t have electrostatics when conductors are present. We had better examine what happens when you put a conductor into an external electric field Eo (Fig. 2.42). Initially, this will drive any free positive charges to the right, and negative ones to the left. (In practice it’s only the negative charges—electrons—that do the moving, but when they depart the right side is left with a net positive charge—the stationary nuclei—so it doesn’t really matter which charges move; the effect is the same.) When they come to the edge of the material, the charges pile up: plus on the right side, minus on the left. Now, these induced charges produce a field of their own, Ei, which, as you can see from the figure, is in the opposite direction to Eo. That’s the crucial point, for it means that the field of the induced charges tends to cancel off the original field. Charge will continue to flow until this cancellation is complete, and the resultant field inside the conductor is precisely zero.7 The whole process is practically instantaneous. + + + + + - E, + + + + E o Figure 2.42 (ii) p = 0 inside a conductor. This follows from Gauss’s law: V E = p/c o- If E = 0, so also is p. There is still charge around, but exactly as much plus charge as minus, so the net charge density in the interior is zero. (iii) Any net charge resides on the surface. That’s the only other place it can be. (iv) A conductor is an equipotential. For if a and b are any two points within (or at the surface of) a given conductor, V (b) - V (a) = - / ab E • d\\ = 0, and hence V (a) = V (b). 7 Outside the conductor the field is not zero, for here Eq and Ej do not cancel. 98 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS Figure 2.43 (v) E is perpendicular to the surface, just outside a conductor. Otherwise, as in (i), charge will immediately flow around the surface uiitil it kills off the tangential component (Fig. 2.43). (Perpendicular to the surface, charge cannot flow, of course, since it is confined to the conducting object.) I think it is strange that the charge on a conductor flows to the surface. Because of their mutual repulsion, the charges naturally spread out as much as possible, but for all of them to go to the surface seems like a waste of the interior space. Surely we could do better, from the point of view of making each charge as far as possible from its neighbors, to sprinkle some of them throughout the volume... Well, it simply is not so. You do best to put all the charge on the surface, and this is true regardless of the size or shape of the conductor.8 The problem can also be phrased in terms of energy. Like any other free dynamical system, the charge on a conductor will seek the configuration that minimizes its potential energy. What property (iii) asserts is that the electrostatic energy of a solid object (with specified shape and total charge) is a minimum when that charge is spread over the surface. For instance, the energy of a sphere is (1 /8tt e0) (q2/R ) if the charge is uniformly distributed over the surface, as we found in Ex. 2.8, but it is greater, (3/20jre0)(q2/R ), if the charge is uniformly distributed throughout the volume (Prob. 2.32). 2.5.2 Induced Charges If you hold a charge +q near an uncharged conductor (Fig. 2.44), the two will attract one another. The reason for this is that q will pull minus charges over to the near side and repel plus charges to the far side. (Another way to think of it is that the charge moves around in such a way as to cancel off the field of q for points inside the conductor, where the total field must be zero.) Since the negative induced charge is closer to q, there is a net force of attraction. (In Chapter 3 we shall calculate this force explicitly, for the case of a spherical conductor.) “By the way, the one- and two-dimensional analogs are quite different: The charge on a conducting disk does not all go to the perimeter (R. Friedberg, Am. J. ofPhys. 61, 1084 (1993)), nor does the charge on a conducting needle go to the ends (D. J. Griffiths and Y. Li, Am. J. ofPhys. 64, 706 (1996)). See Prob. 2.52. 2.5. CONDUCTORS 99 +q + Coiuluclor -H + -- +• Figure 2.44 Figure 2.45 By the way, when I speak of the field, charge, or potential “inside” a conductor, I mean in the “meat” of the conductor; if there is some cavity in the conductor, and within that cavity there is some charge, then the field in the cavity will not be zero. But in a remarkable way the cavity and its contents are electrically isolated from the outside world by the surrounding conductor (Fig. 2.45). No external fields penetrate the conductor; they are canceled at the outer surface by the induced charge there. Similarly, the field due to charges within the cavity is killed off, for all exterior points, by the induced charge on the inner surface. (However, the compensating charge left over on the outer surface of the conductor effectively “communicates” the presence of q to the outside world, as we shall see in Ex. 2.9.) Incidentally, the total charge induced on the cavity wall is equal and opposite to the charge inside, for if we surround the cavity with a Gaussian surface, all points of which are in the conductor (Fig. 2.45), <f E • da = 0, and hence (by Gauss’s law) the net enclosed charge must be zero. But gene = q + q induced • so e/induced = -q. Example 2.9 An uncharged spherical conductor centered at the origin has a cavity of some weird shape carved out of it (Fig. 2.46). Somewhere within the cavity is a charge q. Question: What is the field outside the sphere? Figure 2.46 100 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS Solution: At first glance it would appear that the answer depends on the shape of the cavity and on the placement of the charge. But that’s wrong: The answer is 4tt€q r 2 regardless. The conductor conceals from us all information concerning the nature of the cavity, revealing only the total charge it contains. How can this be? Well, the charge +q induces an opposite charge — q on the wall of the cavity, which distributes itself in such a way that its field cancels that of q, for all points exterior to the cavity. Since the conductor carries no net charge, this leaves +q to distribute itself uniformly over the surface of the sphere. (It’s uniform because the asymmetrical influence of the point charge +q is negated by that of the induced charge -q on the inner surface.) For points outside the sphere, then, the only thing that survives is the field of the leftover +q, uniformly distributed over the outer surface. It may occur to you that in one respect this argument is open to challenge: There are actually three fields at work here, E 9, Ejntiuce(j, and Eieftover. All we know for certain is that the sum of the three is zero inside the conductor, yet I claimed that the first two alone cancel, while the third is separately zero there. Moreover, even if the first two cancel within the conductor, who is to say they still cancel for points outside? They do not, after all, cancel for points inside the cavity. I cannot give you a completely satisfactory answer at the moment, but this much at least is true: There exists a way of distributing — q over the inner surface so as to cancel the field of q at all exterior points. For that same cavity could have been carved out of a huge spherical conductor with a radius of 27 miles or light years or whatever. In that case the leftover +q on the outer surface is simply too far away to produce a significant field, and the other two fields would have to accomplish the cancellation by themselves. So we know they can do it ... but are we sure they choose to? Perhaps for small spheres nature prefers some complicated three-way cancellation. Nope: As we’ll see in the uniqueness theorems of Chapter 3, electrostatics is very stingy with its options; there is always precisely one way—no more—of distributing the charge on a conductor so as to make the field inside zero. Having found a possible way, we are guaranteed that no alternative exists even in principle. If a cavity surrounded by conducting material is itself empty of charge, then the field within the cavity is zero. For any field line would have to begin and end on the cavity wall, going from a plus charge to a minus charge (Fig. 2.47). Letting that field line be part of a closed loop, the rest of which is entirely inside the conductor (where E = 0), the integral Figure 2.47 2.5. CONDUCTORS 101 <f E • d\\ is distinctly positive , in violation of Eq. 2.19. It follows that E = 0 within an empty cavity, and there is in fact no charge on the surface of the cavity. (This is why you are relatively safe inside a metal car during a thunderstorm—you may get cooked, if lightning strikes, but you will not be electrocuted. The same principle applies to the placement of sensitive apparatus inside a grounded Faraday cage, to shield out stray electric fields. In practice, the enclosure doesn’t even have to be solid conductor—chicken wire will often suffice.) Problem 2.35 A metal sphere of radius R, carrying charge q, is surrounded by a thick concentric metal shell (inner radius a, outer radius b, as in Fig. 2.48). The shell carries no net charge. (a) Find the surface charge density a at R, at a, and at b. (b) Find the potential at the center, using infinity as the reference point.

Figure 2.48 Figure 2.49 102 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS 2.5.3 Surface Charge and the Force on a Conductor Because the field inside a conductor is zero, boundary condition 2.33 requires that the field immediately outside is E = —n, (2.48) <?o consistent with our earlier conclusion that the field is normal to the surface. In terms of potential, Eq. 2.36 yields 8V a = -60-T-- (2.49) on These equations enable you to calculate the surface charge on a conductor, if you can determine E or V; we shall use them frequently in the next chapter. In the presence of an electric field, a surface charge will, naturally, experience a force; the force per unit area, f, is crE. But there’s a problem here, for the electric field is discontinuous at a surface charge, so which value are we supposed to use: Eah0Ve• Ebe]0w. or something in between? The answer is that we should use the average of the two: f = CtEa verage — “Cr(E a h0ve T Ebelow)- (2.50) Why the average? The reason is very simple, though the telling makes it sound complicated: Let’s focus our attention on a small patch of surface surrounding the point in question (Fig. 2.50). Make it tiny enough so it is essentially flat and the surface charge on it is essentially constant. The total field consists of two parts—that attributable to the patch itself, and that due to everything else (other regions of the surface, as well as any external sources that may be present): E = E patch T E other • Now, the patch cannot exert a force on itself, any more than you can lift yourself by standing in a basket and pulling up on the handles. The force on the patch, then, is due exclusively to E other, and this suffers no discontinuity (if we removed the patch, the field in the “hole” would be perfectly smooth). The discontinuity is due entirely to the charge on the patch, Figure 2.50 2.5. CONDUCTORS 103 which puts out a field (er/2eo) on either side, pointing away from the surface (Fig. 2.50). Thus, er „ E above = E other T z n, 2e0 E below — E other „ O, 2e0 and hence E other — ^ (E above T E below) — E average • Averaging is really just a device for removing the contribution of the patch itself. That argument applies to any surface charge; in the particular case of a conductor, the field is zero inside and (er/eo)n outside (Eq. 2.48), so the average is (er/2eo)n, and the force per unit area is f=- 1-a 2n. (2.51) 2eo This amounts to an outward electrostatic pressure on the surface, tending to draw the conductor into the field, regardless of the sign of a. Expressing the pressure in terms of the field just outside the surface. Problem 2.37 Two large metal plates (each of area A) are held a distance d apart. Suppose we put a charge Q on each plate; what is the electrostatic pressure on the plates? Problem 2.38 A metal sphere of radius R carries a total charge Q. What is the force of repulsion between the “northern” hemisphere and the “southern” hemisphere? 2.5.4 Capacitors Suppose we have two conductors, and we put charge +Q on one and — Q on the other (Fig. 2.51). Since V is constant over a conductor, we can speak unambiguously of the potential difference between them: p(+) v = V+-V- = - \\ E • dl. J(-) We don’t know how the charge distributes itself over the two conductors, and calculating the field would be a mess, if their shapes are complicated, but this much we do know: E is proportional to Q. For E is given by Coulomb’s law: 104 CHAPTER 2. ELECTROSTATICS +Q Figure 2.51 so if you double p, you double E. (Wait a minute! How do we know that doubling Q (and also — Q) simply doubles pi Maybe the charge moves around into a completely different configuration, quadrupling p in some places and halving it in others, just so the total charge on each conductor is doubled. The fact is (hat this concern is unwarranted—doubling Q does double p everywhere; it doesn 7 shift the charge around. The proof of this will come in Chapter 3; for now you’ll just have to believe me.) Since E is proportional to Q, so also is V. The constant of proportionality is called the capacitance of the arrangement: Q C = ^. (2.53) Capacitance is a purely geometrical quantity, determined by the sizes, shapes, and separation of the two conductors. In SI units, C is measured in farads (F); a farad is a coulomb-per-volt. Actually, this turns out to be inconveniently large;9 more practical units are the microfarad (10—6 F) and the picofarad (10-12 F). Notice that V is, by definition, the potential of the positive conductor less that of the negative one; likewise, Q is the charge of the positive conductor. Accordingly, capacitance is an intrinsically positive quantity. (By the way, you will occasionally hear someone speak of the capacitance of a single conductor. In this case the “second conductor,” with the negative charge, is an imaginary spherical shell of infinite radius surrounding the one conductor. It contributes nothing to the field, so the capacitance is given by Eq. 2.53, where V is the potential with infinity as the reference point.) Example 2.10 Find the capacitance of a “parallel-plate capacitor” consisting of two metal surfaces of area A held a distance d apart (Fig. 2.52). d figure 2.52 9In the second edition I claimed you would need a forklift to carry a 1 F capacitor, case—you can now buy a 1 F capacitor that fits comfortably in a soup spoon. This is no longer the 2.5 . CONDUCTORS 105 Solution: If we put +Q on the top and — Q on the bottom, they will spread out uniformly over the two surfaces, provided the area is reasonably large and the separation distance small.10 The surface charge density, then, is cr = Q/A on the top plate, and so the field, according to Ex. 2.5, is (\\/€q)Q/A. The potential difference between the plates is therefore Q V = —d, Ae0 and hence 5£o d (2.54) If, for instance, the plates are square with sides 1 cm long, and they are held 1 mm apart, then the capacitance is 9 x 10-13 F. Example 2.11 Find the capacitance of two concentric spherical metal shells, with radii a and b. Solution: Place charge +Q on the inner sphere, and — Q on the outer one. The field between the spheres is 47T60 r 2 so the potential difference between them is -r - / E-d l= -- 47r€0 r Jb 1 Q -it dr = 47T60 \\a 1 As promised, V is proportional to Q\\ the capacitance is c = 2= 4**0-^-. V (b-a) To “charge up” a capacitor, you have to remove electrons from the positive plate and carry them to the negative plate. In doing so you fight against the electric field, which is pulling them back toward the positive conductor and pushing them away from the negative one. How much work does it take, then, to charge the capacitor up to a final amount Q1 Suppose that at some intermediate stage in the process the charge on the positive plate is q, so that the potential difference is q/C. According to Eq. 2.38, the work you must do to transport the next piece of charge, dq, is dW = (|) dq. 10The exact solution is not easy—evert for the simpler case of circular plates. See G. T.

CONDUCTORS 109 Problem 2.50 Suppose an electric field E(x, y, z) has the form E x = ax, E y = 0, E z= 0 where a is a constant. What is the charge density? How do you account for the fact that the field points in a particular direction, when the charge density is uniform? [This is a more subtle problem than it looks, and worthy of careful thought.] Problem 2.51 All of electrostatics follows from the 1 /r 2 character of Coulomb’s law, together with the principle of superposition. An analogous theory can therefore be constructed for Newton’s law of universal gravitation. What is the gravitational energy of a sphere, of mass M and radius R, assuming the density is uniform? Use your result to estimate the gravitational energy of the sun (look up the relevant numbers). The sun radiates at a rate of 3.86 x 1026 W; if all this came from stored gravitational energy, how long would the sun last? [The sun is in fact much older than that, so evidently this is not the source of its power.] Problem 2.52 We know that the charge on a conductor goes to the surface, but just how it distributes itself there is not easy to determine.

In each case, sketch the graph of your result. 11 For the derivation (which is a real tour de force) see W. R. Smythe, Static and Dynamic Electricity, 3rd ed. (New York: Hemisphere, 1989), Sect. 5.02. Chapter 3 Special Techniques 3.1 Laplace’s Equation 3.1.1 Introduction The primary task of electrostatics is to find the electric field of a given stationary charge distribution. In principle, this purpose is accomplished by Coulomb’s law, in the form of Eq. 2.8: E(r ) = —-— f -yp{r')dx'. (3.1) 47re0 J n.L Unfortunately, integrals of this type can be difficult to calculate for any but the simplest charge configurations. Occasionally we can get around this by exploiting symmetry and using Gauss’s law, but ordinarily the best strategy is first to calculate the potential, V, which is given by the somewhat more tractable Eq. 2.29: V(r) = —'— f -p(r')dx'. (3.2) 4iteo J 4 Still, even this integral is often too tough to handle analytically. Moreover, in problems involving conductors p itself may not be known in advance: since charge is free to move around, the only thing we control directly is the total charge (or perhaps the potential) of each conductor. In such cases it is fruitful to recast the problem in differential form, using Poisson’s equation (2.24), 9 1 V2V =- p , (3.3) eo which, together with appropriate boundary conditions, is equivalent to Eq. 3.2. Very often, in fact, we are interested in finding the potential in a region where p = 0. (If p = 0 everywhere, of course, then V — 0, and there is nothing further to say—that’s not what I 110 3.1. LAPLACE’S EQUATION 111 mean. There may be plenty of charge elsewhere, but we’re confining our attention to places where there is no charge.) In this case Poisson’s equation reduces to Laplace’s equation: V2V= 0 , (3.4) or, written out in Cartesian coordinates, d2V d2V 92V _ dx2 3y 2 3z2 (3.5) This formula is so fundamental to the subject that one might almost say electrostatics is the study of Laplace’s equation. At the same time, it is a ubiquitous equation, appearing in such diverse branches of physics as gravitation and magnetism, the theory of heat, and the study of soap bubbles. In mathematics it plays a major role in analytic function theory. To get a feel for Laplace’s equation and its solutions (which are called harmonic functions), we shall begin with the one- and two-dimensional versions, which are easier to picture and illustrate all the essential properties of the three-dimensional case (though the one¬ dimensional example lacks the richness of the other two). 3.1.2 Laplace’s Equation in One Dimension Suppose V depends on only one variable, x. Then Laplace’s equation becomes d2V dx2 = 0. The general solution is V {x) = mx + b. (3.6) the equation for a straight line. It contains two undetermined constants (m and b), as is appropriate for a second-order (ordinary) differential equation. They are fixed, in any particular case, by the boundary conditions of that problem. For instance, it might be specified that V = 4 at x = 1, and V = 0 at x = 5. In that case m = -1 and b = 5, so V — —x + 5 (see Fig. 3.1). Figure 3.1 112 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES I want to call your attention to two features of this result; they may seem silly and obvious in one dimension, where I can write down the general solution explicitly, but the analogs in two and three dimensions are powerful and by no means obvious: 1. V(x) is the average of V(x + a) and V(x — a), for any a: V(x) = \\[V{x +a) + V(x — a)}. Laplace’s equation is a kind of averaging instruction; it tells you to assign to the point x the average of the values to the left and to the right of x. Solutions to Laplace’s equation are, in this sense, as boring as they could possibly be, and yet fit the end points properly. 2. Laplace’s equation tolerates no local maxima or minima; extreme values of V must occur at the end points. Actually, this is a consequence of (1), for if there were a local maximum, V at that point would be greater than on either side, and therefore could not be the average. (Ordinarily, you expect the second derivative to be negative at a maximum and positive at a minimum. Since Laplace’s equation requires, on the contrary, that the second derivative be zero, it seems reasonable that solutions should exhibit no extrema. However, this is not a proof, since there exist functions that have maxima and minima at points where the second derivative vanishes: x4, for example, has such a minimum at the point x = 0.) 3.1.3 Laplace’s Equation in Two Dimensions If V depends on two variables, Laplace’s equation becomes d2V d2V _ 3x2 3y2 This is no longer an ordinary differential equation (that is, one involving ordinary derivatives only); it is a partial differential equation. As a consequence, some of the simple rules you may be familiar with do not apply. For instance, the general solution to this equation doesn’t contain just two arbitrary constants—or, for that matter, any finite number—despite the fact that it’s a second-order equation. Indeed, one cannot write down a “general solution” (at least, not in a closed form like Eq. 3.6). Nevertheless, it is possible to deduce certain properties common to all solutions. It may help to have a physical example in mind. Picture a thin rubber sheet (or a soap film) stretched over some support. For definiteness, suppose you take a cardboard box, cut a wavy line all the way around, and remove the top part (Fig. 3.2). Now glue a tightly stretched rubber membrane over the box, so that it fits like a drum head (it won’t be a flat drumhead, of course, unless you chose to cut the edges off straight). Now, if you lay out coordinates (x, y) on the bottom of the box, the height V (x, y) of the sheet above the point 3.1. LAPLACE’S EQUATION 113 Figure 3.2 (x, v) will satisfy Laplace’s equation.1 (The one-dimensional analog would be a rubber band stretched between two points. Of course, it would form a straight line.) Harmonic functions in two dimensions have the same properties we noted in one di¬ mension: 1. The value of V at a point (x, y) is the average of those around the point. More precisely, if you draw a circle of any radius R about the point (x. y), the average value of V on the circle is equal to the value at the center: VU-y, = 2^ j VdL circle (This, incidentally, suggests the method of relaxation on which computer solutions to Laplace’s equation are based: Starting with specified values for V at the boundary, and reasonable guesses for V on a grid of interior points, the first pass reassigns to each point the average of its nearest neighbors. The second pass repeats the process, using the corrected values, and so on. After a few iterations, the numbers begin to settle down, so that subsequent passes produce negligible changes, and a numerical solution to Laplace’s equation, with the given boundary values, has been achieved.)2 2. V has no local maxima or minima; all extrema occur at the boundaries. (As before, this follows from (1).) Again, Laplace’s equation picks the most featureless func¬ tion possible, consistent with the boundary conditions: no hills, no valleys, just the smoothest surface available. For instance, if you put a ping-pong ball on the stretched rubber sheet of Fig. 3.2, it will roll over to one side and fall off—it will not find a Actually, the equation satisfied by a rubber sheet is where g = - 1/2 it reduces (approximately) to Laplace’s equation as long as the surface does not deviate too radically from a plane. 2See, for example, E. M. Purcell, Electricity and Magnetism, 2nd ed., problem 3.30 (p. 119) (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1985). 114 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES “pocket” somewhere to settle into, for Laplace’s equation allows no such dents in the surface. From a geometrical point of view, just as a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, so a harmonic function in two dimensions minimizes the surface area spanning the given boundary line. 3.1.4 Laplace’s Equation in Three Dimensions In three dimensions I can neither provide you with an explicit solution (as in one dimension) nor offer a suggestive physical example to guide your intuition (as I did in two dimensions). Nevertheless, the same two properties remain true, and this time I will sketch a proof. 1. The value of V at point r is the average value of V over a spherical surface of radius R centered at r: '/(r) = s !F / vda   sphere 2. As a consequence, V can have no local maxima or minima; the extreme values of V must occur at the boundaries. (For if V had a local maximum at r, then by the very nature of maximum I could draw a sphere around r over which all values of V—and a fortiori the average—would be less than at r.) Proof: Let’s begin by calculating the average potential over a spherical surface of radius R due to a single point charge q located outside the sphere. We may as well center the sphere at the origin and choose coordinates so that q lies on the z-axis (Fig. 3.3). The potential at a point on the surface is 4jreo ’ where 'Z2 = z2 + R2 — 2zR cos 6, so Lave = But this is precisely the potential due to q at the center of the sphere! By the superposition principle, the same goes for any collection of charges outside the sphere: their average potential over the sphere is equal to the net potential they produce at the center, qed 1 4nR2 An cq — f [z2 + R2 — 2zR cos 0] 1/2 R2 sint? d6 df T€0 J q 4jt€o 2zR _J7_]_ Attcq 2zR — s/z 2 + R2 — 2zR cos ( [(z + R) - (z - R)] = i q Aneo z 3.1. LAPLACE’S EQUATION 115 Problem 3.1 Find the average potential over a spherical surface of radius R due to a point charge q located inside (same as above, in other words, only with z < R). (In this case, of course, Laplace’s equation does not hold within the sphere.) Show that, in general, Lave = ^center + -~, 477 eo I? where Vcenter is the potential at the center due to all the external charges, and (2enc is the total enclosed charge. Problem 3.2 In one sentence, justify Earnshaw’s Theorem: A charged particle cannot be held in a stable equilibrium by electrostatic forces alone. As an example, consider the cubical arrangement of fixed charges in Fig. 3.4. It looks, off hand, as though a positive charge at the center would be suspended in midair, since it is repelled away from each comer. Where is the leak in this “electrostatic bottle”? [To harness nuclear fusion as a practical energy source it is necessary to heat a plasma (soup of charges particles) to fantastic temperatures—so hot that contact would vaporize any ordinary pot. Eamshaw’s theorem says that electrostatic containment is also out of the question. Fortunately, it is possible to confine a hot plasma magnetically.] Figure 3.4 116 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES Problem 3.3 Find the general solution to Laplace’s equation in spherical coordinates, for the case where V depends only on r. Do the same for cylindrical coordinates, assuming V depends only on s. 3.1.5 Boundary Conditions and Uniqueness Theorems Laplace’s equation does not by itself determine V; in addition, a suitable set of boundary conditions must be supplied. This raises a delicate question: What are appropriate boundary conditions, sufficient to determine the answer and yet not so strong as to generate incon¬ sistencies? The one-dimensional case is easy, for here the general solution V = mx + b contains two arbitrary constants, and we therefore require two boundary conditions. We might, for instance, specify the value of the function at the two ends, or we might give the value of the function and its derivative at one end, or the value at one end and the derivative at the other, and so on. But we cannot get away with just the value or just the derivative at one end—this is insufficient information. Nor would it do to specify the derivatives at both ends—this would either be redundant (if the two are equal) or inconsistent (if they are not). In two or three dimensions we are confronted by a partial differential equation, and it is not so easy to see what would constitute acceptable boundary conditions. Is the shape of a taut rubber membrane, for instance, uniquely determined by the frame over which it is stretched, or, like a canning jar lid, can it snap from one stable configuration to another? The answer, as I think your intuition would suggest, is that V is uniquely determined by its value at the boundary (canning jars evidently don’t obey Laplace’s equation). However, other boundary conditions can also be used (see Prob. 3.4). The proof that a proposed set of boundary conditions will suffice is usually presented in the form of a uniqueness theorem. There are many such theorems for electrostatics, all sharing the same basic format—I’ll show you the two most useful ones.3 First uniqueness theorem: The solution to Laplace’s equation in some volume V is uniquely determined if V is specified on the boundary surface S. Proof: In Fig. 3.5 I have drawn such a region and its boundary. (There could also be “islands” inside, so long as V is given on all their surfaces; also, the outer boundary could be at infinity, where V is ordinarily taken to be zero.) Suppose there were two solutions to Laplace’s equation: V2V i=0 and V2V 2 = 0, both of which assume the specified value on the surface. I want to prove that they must be equal. The trick is look at their difference: V3 = Vi~ v 2. 3I do not intend to prove the existence of solutions here—that’s a much more difficult job. In context, the existence is generally clear on physical grounds. 3.1. LAPLACE’S EQUATION 117 V specified on this surface (S) V wanted iri this volume i Vi r Figure 3.5 This obeys Laplace’s equation, V2V3 = V2Vi - V2V 2 = 0, and it takes the value zero on all boundaries (since Vi and V2 are equal there). But Laplace’s equation allows no local maxima or minima—all extrema oc¬ cur on the boundaries. So the maximum and minimum of V3 are both zero. Therefore V3 must be zero everywhere, and hence Vi = V2. qed Example 3.1 Show that the potential is constant inside an enclosure completely surrounded by conducting material, provided there is no charge within the enclosure. Solution: The potential on the cavity wall is some constant, Vo (that’s item (iv), in Sect. 2.5.1), so the potential inside is a function that satisfies Laplace’s equation and has the constant value Vo at the boundary. It doesn’t take a genius to think of one solution to this problem: V = Vo everywhere. The uniqueness theorem guarantees that this is the only solution. (It follows that the field inside an empty cavity is zero—the same result we found in Sect. 2.5.2 on rather different grounds.) The uniqueness theorem is a license to your imagination. It doesn’t matter how you come by your solution; if (a) it satisfies Laplace’s equation and (b) it has the correct value on the boundaries, then it’s right. You’ll see the power of this argument when we come to the method of images. Incidentally, it is easy to improve on the first uniqueness theorem: I assumed there was no charge inside the region in question, so the potential obeyed Laplace’s equation, but 118 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES we may as well throw in some charge (in which case V obeys Poisson’s equation). The argument is the same, only this time ,1 , 1 V2V i =- p , V2V 2 =- P , V2V 3 = V2V ] - V2V 2 = -—p + —p = 0. eo <?o Once again the difference (V3 = Vi — V2) satisfies Laplace’s equation and has the value zero on all boundaries, so V3 = 0 and hence V\\ = Vo- Corollary: The potential in a volume V is uniquely determined if (a) the charge density throughout the region, and (b) the value of V on all boundaries, are specified. 3.1.6 Conductors and the Second Uniqueness Theorem The simplest way to set the boundary conditions for an electrostatic problem is to specify the value of V on all surfaces surrounding the region of interest. And this situation often occurs in practice: In the laboratory, we have conductors connected to batteries, which maintain a given potential, or to ground, which is the experimentalist’s word for V — 0. However, there are other circumstances in which we do not know the potential at the boundary, but rather the charges on various conducting surfaces. Suppose I put charge Q\\ on the first conductor, g 2 on the second, and so on—I’m not telling you how the charge distributes itself over each conducting surface, because as soon as 1 put it on, it moves around in a way I do not control. And for good measure, let’s say there is some specified charge density p in the region between the conductors. Is the electric field now uniquely determined? Or are there perhaps a number of different ways the charges could arrange themselves on their respective conductors, each leading to a different field? Second uniqueness theorem: In a volume V surrounded by conductors and containing a specified charge density p, the electric field is uniquely determined if the total charge on each conductor is given (Fig. 3.6). (The region as a whole can be bounded by another conductor, or else unbounded.) Proof: Suppose there are two fields satisfying the conditions of the problem. Both obey Gauss’s law in differential form in the space between the conductors: 1 1 V • Ei = — p, V • E2 = — p. €0 G) And both obey Gauss’s law in integral form for a Gaussian surface enclosing each conductor: Ei • da — — Qi eo E2 - da = —Qi. eo i th conducting surface / th conducting surface 3.1. LAPLACE’S EQUATION 119 Integration surfaces Likewise, for the outer boundary (whether this is just inside an enclosing con¬ ductor or at infinity), / outer boundary Ei -da = — gtot, eo E 2  d a = outer boundary 1 Gtot- eo As before, we examine the difference E3 = Ei — E2, which obeys V • E 3 = 0 (3.7) in the region between the conductors, and E3• d a = 0 (3.8) over each boundary surface. Now there is one final piece of information we must exploit: Although we do not know how the charge <2 , distributes itself over the / th conducting surface, we do know that each conductor is an eguipotential, and hence V3 is a constant (not necessarily the same constant) over each conducting surface. (It need not be zero, for the potentials Vj and Vo may not be equal—all we know for sure is that both are constant over any given conductor.) Next comes a trick. Invoking product rule number (5), we find that V • (V3E 3) = V3( V -E 3) +E 3 • (V V3) = -(£ 3)2. 120 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES Here I have used Eq. 3.7, and E 3 — — VV 3. Integrating this over the entire region between the conductors, and applying the divergence theorem to the left side: I V-(V 3E 3)fi?r =^V 3E 3 V s   da = — dx. The surface integral covers all boundaries of the region in question—the con¬ ductors and outer boundary. Now V3 is a constant over each surface (if the outer boundary is infinity, V3 = 0 there), so it comes outside each integral, and what remains is zero, according to Eq. 3.8. Therefore, j (E 3)2d x=0. V But this integrand is never negative; the only way the integral can vanish is if £3 = 0 everywhere. Consequently, Ei = E 2, and the theorem is proved. This proof was not easy, and there is a real danger that the theorem itself will seem more plausible to you than the proof. In case you think the second uniqueness theorem is “obvious,” consider this example of Purcell’s: Figure 3.7 shows a comfortable electrostatic configuration, consisting of four conductors with charges EQ, situated so that the plusses are near the minuses. It looks very stable. Now, what happens if we join them in pairs, by tiny wires, as indicated in Fig. 3.8? Since the positive charges are very near negative charges (which is where they like to be) you might well guess that nothing will happen—the configuration still looks stable. Well, that sounds reasonable, but it’s wrong. The configuration in Fig. 3.8 is impossible. For there are now effectively two conductors, and the total charge on each is zero. One possible way to distribute zero charge over these conductors is to have no accumulation of charge anywhere, and hence zero field everywhere (Fig. 3.9). By the second uniqueness theorem, this must be the solution: The charge will flow down the tiny wires, canceling itself off. Figure 3.7 Figure 3.8 3.2. THE METHOD OF IMAGES 121 Problem 3.4 Prove that the field is uniquely determined when the charge density p is given and either V or the normal derivative 3 V/dn is specified on each boundary surface. Do not assume the boundaries are conductors, or that V is constant over any given surface. Problem 3.5 A more elegant proof of the second uniqueness theorem uses Green’s identity (Prob. 1.60c), with T = U = V3. Supply the details. 3.2 The Method of Images 3.2.1 The Classic Image Problem Suppose a point charge q is held a distance d above an infinite grounded conducting plane (Fig. 3.10). Question: What is the potential in the region above the plane? It’s not just (l/4neo)q/'i., for q will induce a certain amount of negative charge on the nearby surface of the conductor; the total potential is due in part to q directly, and in part to this induced charge. But how can we possibly calculate the potential, when we don’t know how much charge is induced or how it is distributed? Figure 3.10 122 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES Figure 3.11 From a mathematical point of view our problem is to solve Poisson’s equation in the region z > 0, with a single point charge q at (0, 0, d), subject to the boundary conditions: 1. V = 0 when z = 0 (since the conducting plane is grounded), and 2. V ->• 0 far from the charge (that is, for x2 + y2 + z2 > d 2). The first uniqueness theorem (actually, its corollary) guarantees that there is only one function that meets these requirements. If by trick or clever guess we can discover such a function, it’s got to be the right answer. Trick: Forget about the actual problem; we’re going to study a completely different situation. This new problem consists of two point charges, +q at (0, 0, d) and —q at (0, 0, —d), and no conducting plane (Fig. 3.11). For this configuration I can easily write down the potential: V(x, y, z) = Aneo six2 + y2 + (z - d)2 ffx2 + y2 + (z + d)2 (3.9) (The denominators represent the distances from (x, y, z) to the charges +q and —q, respec¬ tively.) It follows that 1. V = 0 when z — 0, and 2. V -* 0 for x2 + y2 + z2 » d 2, and the only charge in the region z > 0 is the point charge +q at (0, 0, d). But these are precisely the conditions of the original problem! Evidently the second configuration happens to produce exactly the same potential as the first configuration, in the “upper” region z > 0. (The “lower” region, z < 0, is completely different, but who cares? The upper part is all we need.) Conclusion: The potential of a point charge above an infinite grounded conductor is given by Eq. 3.9, for z > 0. Notice the crucial role played by the uniqueness theorem in this argument: without it, no one would believe this solution, since it was obtained for a completely different charge distribution. But the uniqueness theorem certifies it: If it satisfies Poisson’s equation in the region of interest, and assumes the correct value at the boundaries, then it must be right. 3.2. THE METHOD OF IMAGES 123 3.2.2 Induced Surface Charge Now that we know the potential, it is a straightforward matter to compute the surface charge a induced on the conductor. According to Eq. 2.49, dV a = -€ 0 3 n ’ where dV/dn is the normal derivative of V at the surface. In this case the normal direction is the z-dircction, so a — -eo dV 3 z z=0 From Eq. 3.9, 3V 3 z 1 4^-60 -<?(z -d) [x2 + y2 + (z - d)2]3/ 2 _ q(z +d)_ [x2 + y2 + (z + d)2]3/ 2 so (T(x, y) = —qd (3.10) 2ji(x 2 + y2 + d2)3/2' As expected, the induced charge is negative (assuming q is positive) and greatest at x = y = 0. While we’re at it, let’s compute the total induced charge Q — J a da. This integral, over the xy plane, could be done in Cartesian coordinates, with da = dx dy, but it’s a little easier to use polar coordinates (r, 0), with r2 = x2 + y2 and da =r dr <r/0. Then , , -qd G(r) = and 2 7T pOO Q =n 27t(r2 + d 2)3!2 ’ -9d .. j.. j , 9d 2 n(r 2 + d 2)3/ 2 rdrd(j> = ^Jr2 -y d 2 -q- (3.11) Evidently the total charge induced on the plane is —q, as (with benefit of hindsight) you can perhaps convince yourself it had to be. 3.2.3 Force and Energy The charge q is attracted toward the plane, because of the negative induced charge. Let’s calculate the force of attraction. Since the potential in the vicinity of q is the same as in the analog problem (the one with +q and —q but no conductor), so also is the field and, therefore, the force: F J_ 4jt€q (2d)2 (3.12) 124 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES Beware: It is easy to get carried away, and assume that everything is the same in the two problems. Energy, however, is not the same. With the two point charges and no conductor, Eq. 2.42 gives W = - 1 q1 4ji€q 2d (3.13) But for a single charge and conducting plane the energy is half of this: W = - i q1 47t<?o 4 d Why half? Think of the energy stored in the fields (Eq. 2.45): (3.14) W = y j E 2d r. In the first case both the upper region (z > 0) and the lower region (z < 0) contribute—and by symmetry they contribute equally. But in the second case only the upper region contains a nonzero field, and hence the energy is half as great. Of course, one could also determine the energy by calculating the work required to bring q in from infinity. The force required (to oppose the electrical force in Eq. 3.12) is (l/4^6 0)(g2/4z 2)z, so f V dl=- 1 f ^~2 dz JOQ 4jt€0 Joo 4z2 1 ( q2) d 1 q2 4?reo V 4 z) 00 4?reo 4d As I move q toward the conductor, I do work only on q. It is true that induced charge is moving in over the conductor, but this costs me nothing, since the whole conductor is at potential zero. By contrast, if I simultaneously bring in two point charges (with no conductor), I do work on both of them, and the total is twice as great. 3.2.4 Other Image Problems The method just described is not limited to a single point charge; any stationary charge distribution near a grounded conducting plane can be treated in the same way, by introducing its mirror image—hence the name method of images. (Remember that the image charges have the opposite sign; this is what guarantees that the xy plane will be at potential zero.) There are also some exotic problems that can be handled in similar fashion; the nicest of these is the following. Example 3.2 A point charge q is situated a distance a from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R (Fig. 3.12). Find the potential outside the sphere. 3.2. THE METHOD OF IMAGES 125 Solution: Examine the completely different configuration, consisting of the point charge q together with another point charge / q (3.15) placed a distance (3.16) to the right of the center of the sphere (Fig. 3.13). No conductor, now—just the two point charges. The potential of this configuration is V(r) = -!- (q - + q- 4jT6o \\4 where n, and nl are the distances from q and q', respectively. Now, it happens (see Prob. 3.7) that this potential vanishes at all points on the sphere, and therefore fits the boundary conditions for our original problem, in the exterior region. Conclusion: Eq. 3.17 is the potential of a point charge near a grounded conducting sphere. (Notice that b is less than R, so the “image” charge q' is safely inside the sphere—you cannot put image charges in the region where you are calculating V; that would change p, and you’d be solving Poisson’s equation with the wrong source.) In particular, the force of attraction between the charge and the sphere is 1 qq' 1 q2 Ra 4jre0 (a - b)2 4ne0 (a2 - R2)2 ' (3.18) This solution is delightfully simple, but extraordinarily lucky. There’s as much art as science in the method of images, for you must somehow think up the right “auxiliary problem” to look at. The first person who solved the problem this way cannot have known in advance what image charge q' to use or where to put it. Presumably, he (she?) started with an arbitrary charge at an arbitrary point inside the sphere, calculated the potential on the sphere, and then discovered that with q' and b just right the potential on the sphere vanishes. But it is really a miracle that any choice does the job—with a cube instead of a sphere, for example, no single charge anywhere inside would make the potential zero on the surface. 126 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES Figure 3.14 Problem 3.6 Find the force on the charge +q in Fig. 3.14. (The xy plane is a grounded conductor.) Problem 3.7 (a) U sing the law of cosines, show that Eq. 3.17 can be written as follows: where r and 9 are the usual spherical polar coordinates, with the z axis along the line through q. In this form it is obvious that V = 0 on the sphere, r — R. (b) Find the induced surface charge on the sphere, as a function of 9. Integrate this to get the total induced charge. (What should it be?) (c) Calculate the energy of this configuration. Problem 3.8 In Ex. 3.2 we assumed that the conducting sphere was grounded (V = 0). But with the addition of a second image charge, the same basic model will handle the case of a sphere at any potential Vq (relative, of course, to infinity). What charge should you use, and where should you put it? Find the force of attraction between a point charge q and a neutral conducting sphere. Problem 3.9 A uniform line charge X is placed on an infinite straight wire, a distance d above a grounded conducting plane. (Let’s say the wire runs parallel to the x-axis and directly above it, and the conducting plane is the xy plane.) (a) Find the potential in the region above the plane. (b) Find the charge density o induced on the conducting plane. Problem 3.10 Two semi-infinite grounded conducting planes meet at right angles. In the region between them, there is a point charge q, situated as shown in Fig. 3.15. Set up the image configuration, and calculate the potential in this region. What charges do you need, and where should they be located? What is the force on ql How much work did it take to bring q in from infinity? Suppose the planes met at some angle other than 90°; would you still be able to solve the problem by the method of images? If not, for what particular angles does the method work?

SEPARATION OF VARIABLES 127 Figure 3.15 Figure 3.16 Problem 3.11 Two long, straight copper pipes, each of radius R, are held a distance 2d apart. One is at potential Vq, the other at — Vo (Fig. 3.16). Find the potential everywhere. [Suggestion: Exploit the result of Prob. 2.47.] 33 Separation of Variables In this section we shall attack Laplace’s equation directly, using the method of separation of variables, which is the physicist’s favorite tool for solving partial differential equations. The method is applicable in circumstances where the potential (V) or the charge density (a) is specified on the boundaries of some region, and we are asked to find the potential in the interior. The basic strategy is very simple: We look for solutions that are products of functions, each of which depends on only one of the coordinates. The algebraic details, however, can be formidable, so I’m going to develop the method through a sequence of examples. We’ll start with Cartesian coordinates and then do spherical coordinates (I’ll leave the cylindrical case for you to tackle on your own, in Prob. 3.23). 3.3.1 Cartesian Coordinates Example 3.3 Two infinite grounded metal plates lie parallel to the xz plane, one at y = 0, the other at y = a (Fig. 3.17). The left end, at x = 0, is closed off with an infinite strip insulated from the two plates and maintained at a specific potential Vo(y). Find the potential inside this “slot.” Solution: The configuration is independent of z, so this is really a two-dimensional problem. In mathematical terms, we must solve Laplace’s equation, d2v + d2v (3.20) 128 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES subject to the boundary conditions (i) V — 0 when y = 0, (ii) V = 0 when y = a, (iii) V = Vo(y) when x = 0, (   > (iv) V —r 0 as x —»  oo. (The latter, although not explicitly stated in the problem, is necessary on physical grounds: as you get farther and farther away from the “hot” strip at x =0, the potential should drop to zero.) Since the potential is specified on all boundaries, the answer is uniquely determined. The first step is to look for solutions in the form of products: V(x, y) = X(x)Y(y). (3.22) On the face of it, this is an absurd restriction—the overwhelming majority of solutions to Laplace’s equation do not have such a form. For example, V(x, y) = (5x + 6y) satisfies Eq. 3.20, but you can’t express it as the product of a function x times a function y. Obviously, we’re only going to get a tiny subset of all possible solutions by this means, and it would be a miracle if one of them happened to fit the boundary conditions of our problem ... But hang on. because the solutions we do get are very special, and it turns out that by pasting them together we can construct the general solution. Anyway, putting Eq. 3.22 into Eq. 3.20, we obtain Y d2X dx2 d2Y X dy = 0. The next step is to “separate the variables” (that is, collect all the a-dependence into one term and all the y-dependence into another). Typically, this is accomplished by dividing through by V: 1 d2X _^Y + Y dy2 = 0. (3.23) X dx2 Here the first term depends only on x and the second only on y; in other words, we have an equation of the form fix) + g(y) = 0. (3.24) 3.3. SEPARATION OF VARIABLES 129 Now, there’s only one way this could possibly be true: / and g must both be constant. For what if fix) changed, as you vary x—then if we held y fixed and fiddled with x, the sum f{x) + gix) would change, in violation of Eq. 3.24, which says it’s always zero. (That’s a simple but somehow rather elusive argument; don’t accept it without due thought, because the whole method rides on it.) It follows from Eq. 3.23, then, that 1 d2X 1 d2Y — ——=Ci and — = C2, with Cj + C2 = 0. (3.25) X dx A Y dyz One of these constants is positive, the other negative (or perhaps both are zero). In general, one must investigate all the possibilities; however, in our particular problem we need C] positive and C2 negative, for reasons that will appear in a moment. Thus d2X _ 2 d2Y dx2 ’ dy2 k2Y. (3.26) Notice what has happened: A partial differential equation (3.20) has been converted into two ordinary differential equations (3.26). The advantage of this is obvious—ordinary differential equations are a lot easier to solve. Indeed: X )x) = Aekx + Be~~kx, Y(y) = C sin ky + D cos ky, so that Vix, y) = lAekx + Be~kx)i C sin ky + D cosky). (3.27) This is the appropriate separable solution to Laplace’s equation; it remains to impose the boundary conditions, and see what they tell us about the constants. To begin at the end, condition (iv) requires that A equal zero.4 Absorbing B into C and D, we are left with V(x, y) = e~kx (C sin ky + D cos ky). Condition (i) now demands that D equal zero, so Vix, y) = Ce~kx sin ky. (3.28) Meanwhile (ii) yields sin ka = 0, from which it follows that k=—, (n = 1,2,3,...). (3.29) a (At this point you can see why I chose C\\ positive and C2 negative: If X were sinusoidal, we could never arrange for it to go to zero at infinity, and if Y were exponential we could not make it vanish at both 0 and a. Incidentally, n = 0 is no good, for in that case the potential vanishes everywhere. And we have already excluded negative n’s.) That’s as far as we can go, using separable solutions, and unless Vo(y) just happens to have the form sin(«jry/a) for some integer n we simply can’tfit the final boundary condition at x = 0. But now comes the crucial step that redeems the method: Separation of variables has given us an infinite set of solutions (one for each n), and whereas none of them by itself satisfies 4I’m assuming k is positive, but this involves no loss of generality—negative k gives the same solution (3.27), only with the constants shuffled (A <+ B, C —> —C). Occasionally (but not in this example) k = 0 must also be included (see Prob. 3.47). 130 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES the final boundary condition, it is possible to combine them in a way that does. Laplace’s equation is linear, ih the sense that if V\\, V2, V3, ... satisfy it, so does any linear combination, V = a\\V\\ + (*2 V2 + (*3 V3 + ... , where a\\, 012,     • are arbitrary constants. For V2F = aq V2F i + a 2V 2 V2 + .. • = Ooq 4 - O&2 + ... = 0. Exploiting this fact, we can patch together the separable solutions (3.28) to construct a much more general solution: 00 V(x, y) = J2 Cne ~ nnx/a sin(nny/a). (3.30) This still satisfies the first three boundary conditions; the question is, can we (by astute choice of the coefficients Cn) fit the last boundary condition? 00 m y) = YlC n sin(wjry/a) = V0( y). (3.31) n = 1 Well, you may recognize this sum—it’s a Fourier sine series. And Dirichlet’s theorem 5 guaran¬ tees that virtually any function VoM—it can even have a finite number of discontinuities—can be expanded in such a series. But how do we actually determine the coefficients Cn, buried as they are iti that infinite sum? The device for accomplishing this is so lovely it deserves a name—I call it Fourier’s trick, though it seems Euler had used essentially the same idea somewhat earlier. Here’s how it goes: Multiply Eq. 3.31 by sin(n'jty/a) (where n' is a positive integer), and integrate from 0 to a: “ f a f a l^Cn / sin(«jry/a) sm(n'ny/a) dy = / V0(y) sin(n'jiy/a) dy. (3.32) n=1 J ° You can work out the integral on the left for yourself; the answer is ,a \\ 0, ifw' / sin(«jry/a) sm(n'ny/a)dy = JO (3.33) if n = n. Thus all the terms in the series drop out, save only the one where n' - n, and the left side of Eq. 3.32, reduces to (a/2)C n>. Conclusion:6 2 f a Cn = - I VoOOsin{nny/a)dy. (3.34) a Jo That does it: Eq. 3.30 is the solution, with coefficients given by Eq. 3.34. As a concrete example, suppose the strip at x = 0 is a metal plate with constant potential F 0 (remember, it’s insulated from the grounded plates at y = 0 and y = a). Then Cn 2Vq a L sin(nny/a)dy 2Vq n:x (1 — cos n:x) = 0, 4Vo nn if n is even, if n is odd. (3.35) 5Boas, M., Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, 2nd ed. (New York: John Wiley, 1983). 6For aesthetic reasons I’ve dropped the prime; Eq. 3.34 holds for n = 1,2, 3,... , and it doesn’t matter (obviously) what letter you use for the “dummy” index. 3.3.

Figure 3.18 is a plot of this potential; Fig. 3.19 shows how the first few terms in the Fourier series combine to make a better and better approximation to the constant Vq : (a) is n = 1 only, (b) includes n up to 5, (c) is the sum of the first 10 terms, and (d) is the sum of the first 100 terms. V/Vo y/a Figure 3.19 132 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES Incidentally, the infinite series in Eq. 3.36 can be summed explicitly (try your hand at it, if you like); the result is V(x,y) = — tan-1 sin(7ry/a) sinh(jrx/a) (3.37) In this form it is easy to check that Laplace’s equation is obeyed and the four boundary conditions (3.21) are satisfied. The success of this method hinged on two extraordinary properties of the separable solutions (3.28): completeness and orthogonality. A set of functions f n( y) is said to be complete if any other function f(y ) can be expressed as a linear combination of them; 00 f(y) = YlC nfn(y)- (3-38) n— 1 The functions sin(njiy/a) are complete on the interval 0 < y < a. It was this fact, guaranteed by Dirichlet’s theorem, that assured us Eq. 3.31 could be satisfied, given the proper choice of the coefficients Cn. (The proof of completeness, for a particular set of functions, is an extremely difficult business, and I’m afraid physicists tend to assume it’s true and leave the checking to others.) A set of functions is orthogonal if the integral of the product of any two different members of the set is zero: [ fn{y)fn{y)dy = 0 forn '^n. (3.39) Jo The sine functions are orthogonal (Eq. 3.33); this is the property on which Fourier’s trick is based, allowing us to kill off all terms but one in the infinite series and thereby solve for the coefficients Cn. (Proof of orthogonality is generally quite simple, either by direct integration or by analysis of the differential equation from which the functions came.) Example 3.4 Two infinitely long grounded metal plates, again at y = 0 and y = a, are connected at x — ±b by metal strips maintained at a constant potential Vq, as shown in Fig. 3.20 (a thin layer of insulation at each comer prevents them from shorting out). Find the potential inside the resulting rectangular pipe. Solution: Once again, the configuration is independent of z. Our problem is to solve Laplace’s equation d2v d2v dx2 dy2 subject to the boundary conditions (i) V = 0 when y = 0, (ii) V = 0 when y = a, (iii) V = Vq when x = b, (iv) V = Vq when x = —b. (3.40) 3.3. SEPARATION OF VARIABLES 133 Figure 3.20 The argument runs as before, up to Eq. 3.27: V(x, y) = (Aekx + Be~ kx)( C sin fey + D cosky). This time, however, we cannot set A = 0; the region in question does not extend to x = co, so ekx is perfectly acceptable. On the other hand, the situation is symmetric with respect to x, so V( —X, y) = V(x, y), and it follows that A = B. Using ekx + e~kx = 2c oshfcc, and absorbing 2A into C and D, we have V (x, y) = cosh kx (C sin ky + D cos ky). Boundary conditions (i) and (ii) require, as before, that D = 0 and k = nn/a , so V(x,y) = C cosh(nnx/a) sin(njry/a). (3.41) Because V(x,y) is even in x, it will automatically meet condition (iv) if it fits (iii). It remains, therefore, to construct the general linear combination, oo V(x,y)= ^ Cn cosh(nnx/a) sin(«7ry/a), n=l and pick the coefficients Cn in such a way as to satisfy condition (iii): oo V(b, y) = E Cn cosh(nitb/a) sin(«jry/a) = Vq. n=1 This is the same problem in Fourier analysis that we faced before; I quote the result from Eq. 3.35: f 0 , if n is even Cn cosh(nnb/a) 4Vq n:x if n is odd 134 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES Figure 3.21 Conclusion: The potential in this case is given by V(,-,y)=^ £ jt n cosh(«jr£>/a) n = l,3,5... 1 cosh(ujr.r/a) sin (nny/a). (3.42) This function is shown in Fig. 3.21. Example 3.5 An infinitely long rectangular metal pipe (sides a and b) is grounded, but one end, at x = 0, is maintained at a specified potential Vb(.v, z), as indicated in Fig. 3.22. Find the potential inside the pipe. Solution: This is a genuinely three-dimensional problem, d2v dx2 + d2v (3.43) Figure 3.22 3.3. SEPARATION OF VARIABLES 135 subject to the boundary conditions (i) V = 0 when y = 0, (ii) V = 0 when y = a, (iii) V = 0 when z = 0, (iv) V = 0 when z   = b. (v) V —y 0 as x —* OO, (vi) V = Vo(y, z) when As always, we look for solutions that are products: V(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z{z). (3.44) (3.45) Putting this into Eq. 3.43, and dividing by V, we find It follows that 1 d2X 1 d2Y 1 d2Z X dx2 Y dy2 Z dz2 1 d2X 1 d2Y 1 d2Z X~dx^ ~ h Y~dy2 ~ C l' Z. Jz 2 ~C 3 with Ci + C2 + C3 = 0. Our previous experience (Ex. 3.3) suggests that C\\ must be positive, C2 and C3 negative. Setting C2 = —k2 and C3 = —l2, we have C\\ =k 2 + l2, and hence d2X dx2 = (k2 + l2)X. d2Y dy2 k2Y, d2Z dz2 = -l 2Z. (3.46) Once again, separation of variables has turned a partial differential equation into ordinary differential equations. The solutions are X(x) = Ae^+^ x +Be~^+ iIx, Y(y) = C sin ky + D cos ky, Z(z) = E sin lz + F coslz. Boundary condition (v) implies A = 0, (i) gives D = 0, and (iii) yields /•' = 0, whereas (ii) and (iv) require that k = mi/a and / = rrni/b, where n and m are positive integers. Combining the remaining constants, we are left with V(x, y, z) = Ce~7Z^ {n/a)2+{mlb)2x sin(rt7Ty/a) sin(mnz/b). (3.47) This solution meets all the boundary conditions except (vi). It contains two unspecified integers (n and m), and the most general linear combination is a double sum: DO DO V(x, y, z) = J2 Cn me-7T^/(n/a)2+(m/b)2x Sm(njzy/a) sm(mnz/b).

Here l(l + 1) is just a fancy way of writing the separation constant—you’ll see in a minute why this is convenient. 7The general case, for ^-dependent potentials, is treated in all the graduate texts. See, for instance, J. D. Jackson’s Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd ed., Chapter 3 (New York: John Wiley, 1999). 138 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES As always, separation of variables has converted a partial differential equation (3.54) into ordinary differential equations (3.57). The radial equation, d ~cH ,dR dr r~ —— I — 1(1 + 1)/?, (3.58) has the general solution R(r) = Arl+ (3.59) as you can easily check; A and B are the two arbitrary constants to be expected in the solution of a second-order differential equatiqn. But the angular equation, d de sin#- d@ ~d9 —1(1 + 1) sin# 0, (3.60) is not so simple. The solutions are Legendre polynomials in the variable cos 6: 0(6i) = (cos 6>). (3.61) P{(x) is most conveniently defined by the Rodrigues formula: p 'w = s i(£) ,( i2- i )' (3'62) The first few Legendre polynomials are listed in Table 3.1. P 0(x) = 1 Pl(x) = X P 2(x) = (3x2 - l)/2 P 2( x) = (5x3 — 3x)/2 P A(x) = (35x4 - 30x2 + 3)/8 P$(x) = (63x5 — 70x3 + 15x)/8 Table 3.1 Legendre Polynomials Notice that Pi(x) is (as the name suggests) an /th-orderp olynomial in x; it contains only even powers, if l is even, and odd powers, if l is odd. The factor in front (1 /2 // !) was chosen in order that Pl( 1) = 1. (3.63) The Rodrigues formula obviously works only for nonnegative integer values of l. More¬ over, it provides us with only one solution. But Eq. 3.60 is second-order, and it should pos¬ sess two independent solutions, for every value of/. It turns out that these “other solutions” 3.3. SEPARATION OF VARIABLES 139 blow up at 8 =0 and/or 6 = n, and are therefore unacceptable on physical grounds.8 For instance, the second solution for / =0 is 0(0) = In ^tan 0 . (3.64) You might want to check for yourself that this satisfies Eq. 3.60. In the case of azimuthal symmetry, then, the most general separable solution to Laplace’s equation, consistent with minimal physical requirements, is V(r,6) = Arl + B 7*/+1 Pli COS0). (There was no need to include an overall constant in Eq. 3.61 because it can be absorbed into A and B at this stage.) As before, separation of variables yields an infinite set of solutions, one for each /. The general solution is the linear combination of separable solutions: 00 V(r,0) = J2 1=0 Atr l + B, fl~\\~ 1 Pi (cos 6). (3.65) The following examples illustrate the power of this important result. Example 3.6 The potential Vq(6) is specified on the surface of a hollow sphere, of radius R. Find the potential inside the sphere.

Yes: The Legendre polynomials (like the sines) constitute a complete set of functions, on the interval — 1 < x < 1 8 In rare cases where the z axis is for some reason inaccessible, these “other solutions” may have to be considered. 140 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES (0 < 6 < n). How do we determine the constants? Again, by Fourier’s trick, for the Legendre polynomials (like the sines) are orthogonal functions:9 /: Pl(x)Pii(x)dx = f Pi(cos6)Pir(cosd)sm6 d6 Jo 0, if I'^l, 2 (3.68) 21 + 1’ if ! =1.

(3.69) Equation 3.66 is the solution to our problem, with the coefficients given by Eq. 3.69. In can be difficult to evaluate integrals of the form 3.69 analytically, and in practice it is often easier to solve Eq. 3.67 “by eyeball.”10 For instance, suppose we are told that the potential on the sphere is Vq(6) = fcsin2( 6>/2), (3.70) where k is a constant. Using the half-angle formula, we rewrite this as Vo(0) = ^(1 — cos#) = ^[P 0(cos<9) - P!(cos0)]. Putting this into Eq. 3.67, we read off immediately that Aq = k/2, A ] = —k/(2R), and all other A/'s vanish. Evidently, V(r, 6) = - r°Po(cos6) — —P\\(cos6) R (i-^cose). (3.71) Example 3.7 The potential Vo (0) is again specified on the surface of a sphere of radius R, but this time we are asked to find the potential outside, assuming there is no charge there. Solution: In this case it’s the A/'s that must be zero (or else V would not go to zero at oo), so ^ Bi V(r,0) = J2^ p l(Cose). (3.72) i=0 r ®M. Boas, Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, 2nd ed., Section 12.7 (New York: John Wiley. 1983). 10This is certainly true whenever Vq(6) can be expressed as a polynomial in cos 8. The degree of the polynomial tells us the highest / we require, and the leading coefficient determines the corresponding A/. Subtracting oft A/R 1 P/(cosd) and repeating the process, we systematically work our way down to Aq. Notice that if Vo ls an even function of cosd, then only even terms will occur in the sum (and likewise for odd functions). 3.3.

(3.73) Equation 3.72, with the coefficients given by Eq. 3.73, is the solution to our problem. Example 3.8 An uncharged metal sphere of radius R is placed in an otherwise uniform electric field E = Eqz. [The field will push positive charge to the “northern” surface of the sphere, leaving a negative charge on the “southern” surface (Fig. 3.24). This induced charge, in turn, distorts the field in the neighborhood of the sphere.] Find the potential in the region outside the sphere. Solution: The sphere is an equipotential—we may as well set it to zero. Then by symmetry the entire xy plane is at potential zero. This time, however, V does not go to zero at large z. In fact, far from the sphere the field is E 0z, and hence V ->   -E 0z + C. Figure 3.24 142 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES Since V — 0 in the equatorial plane, the constant C must be zero. Accordingly, the boundary conditions for this problem are (i) V = 0 when r = R, (ii) V^>—Egrcos6 for r 2> R. We must fit these boundary conditions with a function of the form 3.65. The first condition yields or AtR l + Bi Rl+1 = 0, B[ = -A[R 2I+1, (3.74) (3.75) so 00 / , R2l+l \\ V(r,0) = J2 A l[ r- l+T ) p l( ~c0s9 '>- 1=0 \\ r / For r R, the second term in parentheses is negligible, and therefore condition (ii) requires that oo A/7 P/(cost?) = —E^rcosO. 1=0 Evidently, only one term is present: / = 1. In fact, since Pi (cos 60 = cos#, we can read off immediately Ai = — Eq, all other Af s zero. Conclusion: V{r,0) = —E0 r P 3\\ Icost?. (3.76) The first term ( — Egr cos 6) is due to the external field: the contribution attributable to the induced charge is evidently R3 Eo^r COS 0. rl If you want to know the induced charge density, it can be calculated in the usual way: <r(0) = - «4) dv_ 97 r=R , R , = €0 Eg 1 +2—= cost? = 3egEgCOS0. (3.77) r=R As expected, it is positive in the “northern” hemisphere (0 < t? < n/2) and negative in the “southern” (n/2 < t? < it). Example 3.9 A specified charge density o-q (t?) is glued over the surface of a spherical shell of radius R. Find the resulting potential inside and outside the sphere. Solution: You could, of course, do this by direct integration: 1 f CO V = 47reg I da. 3.3. SEPARATION OF VARIABLES 143 but separation of variables is often easier. For the interior region we have 00 V(r. 9) = ^ Atr lP j(cos 6) (r < R) (3.78) 1=0 (no B; terms—they blow up at the origin); in the exterior region 00 Bi V(r.e) = J2-^l P tVos9) (r > R) (3.79) 1=0 r (no A/ terms—they don’t go to zero at infinity). These two functions must be joined together by the appropriate boundary conditions at the surface itself. First, the potential is continuous at r = R (Eq. 2.34): oo 00 Bi J2 AiRlP i(cos9) = J2 Pi (cos 9). (3.80) 1=0 1=0 K It follows that the coefficients of like Legendre polynomials are equal: Bi = AiR2l+l. (3.81) (To prove tljat formally, multiply both sides of Eq. 3.80 by P v (cos 9) sin 0 and integrate from 0 to 7t, using the orthogonality relation 3.68.) Second, the radial derivative of V suffers a discontinuity at the surface (Eq. 2.36): 9 Lout 9 V'u dr dr =- r=R 60 (3.82) Thus 1=0 or, using Eq. 3.81: B , ~Y.( l + 2P /(cos6)) - J2 l AlR l~]p l(COS<9) = - — cr0( 6), 1=0 1 V(2Z + VAtR^PficosO) = —a o( 0). e0 1=0 From here, the coefficients can be determined using Fourier’s trick: 4/ = 2c0 Rl 4 ' <jq(9)Pi (cos 9) sin 9 d6. (3.83) (3.84) Equations 3.78 and 3.79 constitute the solution to our problem, with the coefficients given by Eqs. 3.81 and 3.84. For instance, if c7q(9) = kcos6 = kP\\ (cos 4), for some constant k, then all the Af s are zero except for 1=1, and (3.85) = — [ 260 Jo A\\ = -— I [Pi(cos60]2s in6><76> = -• 3e0 144 CHAPTER 3.

SPECIAL TECHNIQUES 3.4 Multipole Expansion 3.4.1 Approximate Potentials at Large Distances If you are very far away from a localized charge distribution, it “looks” like a point charge, and the potential is—to good approximation— (l/4jzeo)Q/r, where Q is the total charge. We have often used this as a check on formulas for V. But what if Q is zero? You might reply that the potential is then approximately zero, and of course, you’re right, in a sense (indeed, the potential at large r is pretty small even if Q is not zero). But we’re looking for something a bit more informative than that. Example 3.10 A (physical) electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges (±q) separated by a distance d. Find the approximate potential at points far from the dipole. Solution: Let-2-- be the distance from — q and-2-+ the distance from +q (Fig. 3.26). Then 1 ( <?

MULTIPOLE EXPANSION 147 Monopole (V~ Hr) tr Dipole Quadrupole Octopole (V~l /r2) (V~ 1/r3) (V ~ 1/r4) Figure 3.27 Evidently the potential of a dipole goes like 1/r2 at large r; as we might have anticipated, it falls off more rapidly than the potential of a point charge. Incidentally, if we put together a pair of equal and opposite dipoles to make a quadrupole, the potential goes like 1/r3; for back-to-back quadrupoles (an octopole) it goes like 1 /r 4; and so on. Figure 3.27 summarizes this hierarchy; for completeness I have included the electric monopole (point charge), whose potential, of course, goes like 1/r. Example 3.10 pertained to a very special charge configuration. I propose now to develop a systematic expansion for the potential of an arbitrary localized charge distribution, in powers of 1/r. Figure 3.28 defines the appropriate variables; the potential at r is given by ',<r)=4^/^ (r')',r' <3-9,» Using the law of cosines. -2-2 = r2 + (r')2 — 2rr'cos#' = r2 r'\\ 2 Mr’ 1 + ( — j — 2 ^ — I cos#' or where = r*JT (3.92) For points well outside the charge distribution, e is much less than 1, and this invites a binomial expansion: I = i(l+ C)-i/2 = ifi_i e+ 3 2 _ 5 3 n, r r \\ 2 8 16 (3.93) P Figure 3.28 148 CHAPTER 3.

The remarkable result11 is that 1 'i 1 r Pn(cOs0'), (3.94) where O' is the angle between r and r Substituting this back into Eq. 3.91, and noting that r is a constant, as far as the integration is concerned, I conclude that V (r) Cr')nP n(cosO')p(r')dr', (3.95) or, more explicitly, V (r) -- - f p(r')dz' + ^ f r'cos0'p(r') dr' 4jre0 lr J rl J + j (J cos2 ~ ^ P(r/) dr' + ... (3.96) This is the desired result—the multipole expansion of V in powers of 1/r. The first term (n = 0) is the monopole contribution (it goes like 1/r); the second (n = 1) is the dipole (it goes like 1/r2); the third is quadrupole; the fourth octopole; and so on. As it stands, Eq. 3.95 is exact, but it is useful primarily as an approximation scheme: the lowest nonzero term in the expansion provides the approximate potential at large r, and the successive terms tell us how to improve the approximation if greater precision is required. 11 Incidentally, this affords a second way of obtaining the Legendre polynomials (the first being Rodrigues' formula); 1H is called the generating function for Legendre polynomials. 3.4. MULTIPOLE EXPANSION 149 Problem 3.26 A sphere of radius R, centered at the origin, carries charge density , R p(r, 9) = k-^(R — 2r) sin#, rl where k is a constant, and r, 9 are the usual spherical coordinates. Find the approximate potential for points on the z axis, far from the sphere. 3.4.2 The Monopole and Dipole Terms Ordinarily, the multipole expansion is dominated (at large r) by the monopole term: Vmon(r) 1 Q 4;reo r (3.97) where Q = J p dr is the total charge of the configuration. This is just what we expected for the approximate potential at large distances from the charge. Incidentally, for a point charge at the origin, Vmon represents the exact potential everywhere, not merely a first approximation at large r; in this case all the higher multipoles vanish. If the total charge is zero, the dominant term in the potential will be the dipole (unless, of course, it also vanishes): 1 1 f Vdip(r) = -- - I r' cosO'p(r') dr'. 4:reo rz J Since O' is the angle between r and r (Fig. 3.28), r' cos O' = r • r', and the dipole potential can be written more succinctly: Vdip(r) 1 1 j r'p{r')dT'. lp 7 Aizeo r2 This integral, which does not depend on r at all, is called dipole moment of the distribution: P = p(rVr 7, (3.98) and the dipole contribution to the potential simplifies to Vdip(r) = 1 p - r 4;reo r2 (3.99) 150 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES The dipole moment is determined by the geometry (size, shape, and density) of the charge distribution. Equation 3.98 translates in the usual way (Sect. 2.1.4) for point, line, and surface charges. Thus, the dipole moment of a collection of point charges is P=£<?*r ,'- (3.100) ( = 1 For the “physical” dipole (equal and opposite charges, ±q) p = qr'+ - qr'_ = q(r'+ — r'_) = qd, (3.101) where d is the vector from the negative charge to the positive one (Fig. 3.29). Is this consistent with what we got for a physical dipole, in Ex. 3.10? Yes: If you put Eq. 3.100 into Eq. 3.99, you recover Eq. 3.90. Notice, however, that this is only the approximate potential of the physical dipole—evidently there are higher multipole contributions. Of course, as you go farther and farther away, Vdip becomes a better and better approximation, since the higher terms die off more rapidly with increasing r. By the same token, at a fixed r the dipole approximation improves as you shrink the separation d. To construct a “pure” dipole whose potential is given exactly by Eq. 3.99, you’d have to let d approach zero. Unfortunately, you then lose the dipole term too, unless you simultaneously arrange for q to go to infinity! A physical dipole becomes a pure dipole, then, in the rather artificial limit d 0, q ->• oo, with the product qd = p held fixed. (When someone uses the word “dipole,” you can’t always tell whether they mean a physical dipole (with finite separation between the charges) or a pure (point) dipole. If in doubt, assume that d is small enough (compared to r) that you can safely apply Eq. 3.99.) Dipole moments are vectors, and they add accordingly: if you have two dipoles, pi and P2, the total dipole moment is pi + P2. For instance, with four charges at the corners of a square, as shown in Fig. 3.30, the net dipole moment is zero. You can see this by combining the charges in pairs (vertically, l + f = 0, or horizontally, —» + = 0) or by adding up the four contributions individually, using Eq. 3.100. This is a quadrupole, as I indicated earlier, and its potential is dominated by the quadrupole term in the multipole expansion.) Figure 3.29 Figure 3.30 3.4. MULTIPOLE EXPANSION 151 Figure 3.31 Problem 3.27 Four particles (one of charge q, one of charge 3q, and two of charge —2q) are placed as shown in Fig. 3.31, each a distance a from the origin. Find a simple approximate formula for the potential, valid at points far from the origin. (Express your answer in spherical coordinates.) Problem 3.28 In Ex. 3.9 we derived the exact potential for a spherical shell of radius R, which carries a surface charge a = k cos 9. (a) Calculate the dipole moment of this charge distribution. (b) Find the approximate potential, at points far from the sphere, and compare the exact answer (3.87). What can you conclude about the higher multipples? Problem 3.29 For the dipole in Ex. 3.10, expand 1 to order (d/r ) \\and use this to determine the quadrupole and octopole terms in the potential. 3.4.3 Origin of Coordinates in Multipole Expansions I mentioned earlier that a point charge at the origin constitutes a “pure” monopole. If it is not at the origin, it’s no longer a pure monopole. For instance, the charge in Fig. 3.32 has a dipole moment p = qdy, and a corresponding dipole term in its potential. The monopole potential (l/4neo)q/r is not quite correct for this configuration; rather, the exact potential is (l/4jreo)<?A- The multipole expansion is, remember, a series in inverse powers of r (the distance to the origin), and when we expand l/n. we get all powers, not just the first. So moving the origin (or, what amounts to the same thing, moving the charge) can radically alter a multipole expansion. The monopole moment Q does not change, since the total charge is obviously independent of the coordinate system. (In Fig. 3.32 the monopole term was unaffected when we moved q away from the origin—it’s just that it was no longer the whole story: a dipole term—and for that matter all higher poles—appeared as well.) Ordinarily, the dipole moment does change when you shift the origin, but there is an important exception: If the total charge is zero, then the dipole moment is independent of 152 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES Figure 3.32 Figure 3.33 the choice of origin. For suppose we displace the origin by an amount a (Fig. 3.33). The new dipole moment is then p = j r'p(r')dz' = j (r' - a)p(r')dz' = j r'p(r') dz' — a j p(r') dz' = p - Qa. In particular, if Q = 0, then p = p. So if someone asks for the dipole moment in Fig. 3.34(a), you can answer with confidence “qd,” but if you’re asked for the dipole moment in Fig. 3.34(b) the appropriate response would be: “With respect to what originT d -<? a a (b) Figure 3.34 Problem 3.30 Two point charges, 3q and —q, are separated by a distance a. For each of the arrangements in Fig. 3.35, find (i) the monopole moment, (ii) the dipole moment, and (iii) the approximate potential (in spherical coordinates) at large r (include both the monopole and dipole contributions). 3.4.4 The Electric Field of a Dipole So far we have worked only with potentials. Now I would like to calculate the electric^ieW of a (pure) dipole. If we choose coordinates so that p lies at the origin and points in the z direction (Fig. 3.36), then the potential at r, 6 is (Eq. 3.99): Edip (r,0) r • p p cos 6 4jreo r1 4jreor2 To get the field, we take the negative gradient of V: (3.102) Thus dV 2pco&6 dr 4jreof3 1 dV psinO r d0 Aneor3, ’ 1 dv -0 r sin 6 d<p (3.103) Figure 3.36 154 CHAPTER 3. SPECIAL TECHNIQUES This formula makes explicit reference to a particular coordinate system (spherical) and assumes a particular orientation for p (along z). It can be recast in a coordinate-free form, analogous to the potential in Eq. 3.99—see Prob. 3.33. Notice that the dipole field falls off as the inverse cube of r; the monopole field (Q / Artfor-)! goes as the inverse square, of course. Quadrupole fields go like 1/r4, oc- topole like 1/r5, and so on. (This merely reflects the fact that monopole potentials fall off like 1/r, dipole like 1/r2, quadrupole like 1 /r 3, and so on—the gradient introduces another factor of 1/r.) Figure 3.37(a) shows the field lines of a “pure” dipole (Eq. 3.103). For comparison. I have also sketched the field lines for a “physical” dipole, in Fig. 3.37(b). Notice how similar the two pictures become if you blot out the central region; up close, however, they are entirely different. Only for points r d does Eq. 3.103 represent a valid approximation to the field of a physical dipole. As I mentioned earlier, this regime can be reached either by going to large r or by squeezing the charges very close together.12 Figure 3.37 Problem 3.31 A “pure” dipole p is situated at the origin, pointing in the z direction.

MULTIPOLE EXPANSION 157 (a) Show that the average field due to a single charge q at point r inside the sphere is the same as the field at r due to a uniformly charged sphere with p = —q/(^nR^), namely 1 1 M * J / 4tre0 (jTrfl3) J * 2 where 1 is the vector from r to dx'. (b) The latter can be found from Gauss’s law (see Prob. 2.12). Express the answer in terms of the dipole moment of q. (c) Use the superposition principle to generalize to an arbitrary charge distribution. (d) While you’re at it, show that the average field over the sphere due to all the charges outside is the same as the field they produce at the center. Problem 3.42 Using Eq. 3.103, calculate the average electric field of a dipole, over a spherical volume of radius R, centered at the origin. Do the angular intervals first. [Note: You must express f and 6 in terms of x, y, and z (see back cover) before integrating. If you don’t understand why, reread the discussion in Sect. 1.4.1.] Compare your answer with the general theorem Eq. 3.105. The discrepancy here is related to the fact that the field of a dipole blows up at r = 0. The angular integral is zero, but the radial integral is infinite, so we really don’t know what to make of the answer. To resolve this dilemma, let’s say that Eq. 3.103 applies outside a tiny sphere of radius e—its contribution to E ave is then unambiguously zero, and the whole answer has to come from the field inside the e-sphere. (b) What must the field inside the e-sphere be, in order for the general theorem (3.105) to hold? [Hint: since e is arbitrarily small, we’re talking about something that is infinite at r = 0 and whose integral over an infinitesimal volume is finite.] [Answer: —(p/3eo)^3 (r )] [Evidently, the true field of a dipole is EdipW = —'— -4 [3(p • r)r — p] - p5 3( r). (3.106) 47reo ri 3eg You may well wonder how we missed the delta-function term when we calculated the field back in Sect. 3.4.4. The answer is that the differentiation leading to Eq. 3.103 is perfectly valid except at r = 0, but we should have known (from our experience in Sect. 1.5.1) that the point r = 0 is problematic.

Chapter 4 Electric Fields in Matter 1.1 Polarization 4.1.1 Dielectrics In this chapter we shall study electric fields in matter. Matter, of course, comes in many varieties—solids, liquids, gases, metals, woods, glasses—and these substances do not all respond in the same way to electrostatic fields. Nevertheless, most everyday objects belong (at least, in good approximation) to one of two large classes: conductors and insulators (or dielectrics). We have already talked about conductors; these are substances that contain an “unlimited” supply of charges that are free to move about through the material. In practice what this ordinarily means is that many of the electrons (one or two per atom in a typical metal) are not associated with any particular nucleus, but roam around at will. In dielectrics, by contrast, all charges are attached to specific atoms or molecules—they’re on a tight leash, and all they can do is move a bit within the atom or molecule. Such microscopic displacements are not as dramatic as the wholesale rearrangement of charge in a conductor, but their cumulative effects account for the characteristic behavior of dielectric materials. There are actually two principal mechanisms by which electric fields can distort the charge distribution of a dielectric atom or molecule: stretching and rotating. In the next two sections I’ll discuss these processes. 4.1.2 Induced Dipoles What happens to a neutral atom when it is placed in an electric field E? Your first guess might well be: “Absolutely nothing—since the atom is not charged, the field has no effect on it.” But that is incorrect. Although the atom as a whole is electrically neutral, there is a positively charged core (the nucleus) and a negatively charged electron cloud surrounding it. These two regions of charge within the atom are influenced by the field: the nucleus is pushed in the direction of the field, and the electrons the opposite way. In principle, if the field is large enough, it can pull the atom apart completely, “ionizing” it (the substance 160 4.1. POLARIZATION 161 then becomes a conductor). With less extreme fields, however, an equilibrium is soon established, for if the center of the electron cloud does not coincide with the nucleus, these positive and negative charges attract one another, and this holds the atoms together. The two opposing forces—E pulling the electrons and nucleus apart, their mutual attraction drawing them together—reach a balance, leaving the atom polarized, with plus charge shifted slightly one way, and minus the other. The atom now has a tiny dipole moment p, which points in the same direction as E. Typically, this induced dipole moment is approximately proportional to the field (as long as the latter is not too strong): p = aE. (4.1) The constant of proportionality a is called atomic polarizability. Its value depends on the detailed structure of the atom in question. Table 4.1 lists some experimentally determined atomic polarizabilities. H He Li Be C Ne Na Ar K Cs 0.667 0.205 24.3 5.60 1.76 0.396 24.1 1.64 43.4 59.6 Table 4.1 Atomic Polarizabilities (a/4ne(), in units of 10-30 m3). Source: Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 78th ed. (Boca Raton: CRC Press, Inc., 1997). Example 4.1 A primitive model for an atom consists of a point nucleus (+<?) surrounded by a uniformly charged spherical cloud (—q) of radius a (Fig. 4.1). Calculate the atomic polarizability of such an atom. Solution: In the presence of an external field E, the nucleus will be shifted slightly to the right and the electron cloud to the left, as shown in Fig. 4.2. (Because the actual displacements -q E Figure 4.1 Figure 4.2 162 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER involved are extremely small, as you’ll see in Prob. 4.1, it is reasonable to assume that the electron cloud retains its spherical shape.) Say that equilibrium occurs when the nucleus is displaced a distance d from the center of the sphere. At that point the external field pushing the nucleus to the right exactly balances the internal field pulling it to the left: E = Ee, where Ee is the field produced by the electron cloud. Now the field at a distance d from the center of a uniformly charged sphere is 77 1 4d Ee — ~ T 47TCq (Prob. 2.12). At equilibrium, then, 1 qd , E = --or p = qd = {Anena )E. 4jreQ The atomic polarizability is therefore a = Airega3 = 3eQV, (4.2) where v is the volume of the atom. Although this atomic model is extremely crude, the result (4.2) is not too bad—it’s accurate to within a factor of four or so for many simple atoms. For molecules the situation is not quite so simple, because frequently they polarize more readily in some directions than others. Carbon dioxide (Fig. 4.3), for instance, has a polarizability of 4.5 x 10 40 C2 m/N when you apply the field along the axis of the molecule, but only 2 x 10-40 for fields perpendicular to this direction. When the field is at some angle to the axis, you must resolve it into parallel and perpendicular components, and multiply each by the pertinent polarizability: p = axEj_ + Qf|jE||. In this case the induced dipole moment may not even be in the same direction as E. And CO2 is relatively simple, as mblecules go, since the atoms at least arrange themselves in a straight line; for a completely asymmetrical molecule Eq. 4.1 is replaced by the most general linear relation between E and p: Px — otxxE x T - a Xy Ey E- Py tX yx E X CtyyEy Ot y£ E t pz = <xzx Ex + a zy E y + a zz E z (4.3) () C Figure 4.3 4.1. POLARIZATION 163 The set of nine constants a,/ constitute the polarizability tensor for the molecule. Their actual values depend on the orientation of the axes you chose, though it is always possible to choose “principal” axes such that all the off-diagonal terms (a xy, a zx, etc.) vanish, leaving just three nonzero polarizabilities: a xx, a yy, and a zz. Problem 4.1 A hydrogen atom (with the Bohr radius of half an angstrom) is situated between two metal plates 1 mm apart, which are connected to opposite terminals of a 500 V battery. What fraction of the atomic radius does the separation distance d amount to, roughly? Estimate the voltage you would need with this apparatus to ionize the atom. [Use the value of a in Table 4.1. Moral: The displacements we’re talking about are minute, even on an atomic scale.] Problem 4.2 According to quantum mechanics, the electron cloud for a hydrogen atom in the ground state has a charge density. p(r) = -^ 3e - 2r' a, TtaJ where q is the charge of the electron and a is the Bohr radius. Find the atomic polarizability of such an atom. [Hint: First calculate the electric field of the electron cloud, E e{r) \\ then expand the exponential, assuming r a. For a more sophisticated approach, see W. A. Bowers, Am. J. Phys. 54, 347 (1986).] Problem 4.3 According to Eq. 4.1, the induced dipole moment of an atom is proportional to the external field. This is a “rule of thumb,” not a fundamental law, and it is easy to concoct exceptions—in theory. Suppose, for example, the charge density of the electron cloud were proportional to the distance from the center, out to a radius R. To what power of E would p be proportional in that case? Find the condition on p(r) such that Eq. 4.1 will hold in the weak-field limit. Problem 4.4 A point charge q is situated a large distance r from a neutral atom of polarizability a. Find the force of attraction between them. 4.1.3 Alignment of Polar Molecules The neutral atom discussed in Sect. 4.1.2 had no dipole moment to start with—p was induced by the applied field. Some molecules have built-in, permanent dipole moments. In the water molecule, for example, the electrons tend to cluster around the oxygen atom (Fig. 4.4), and since the molecule is bent at 105°, this leaves a negative charge at the vertex and a net positive charge at the opposite end. (The dipole moment of water is unusually large: 6.1 x 10“30 C m; in fact, this is what accounts for its effectiveness as a solvent.) What happens when such molecules (called polar molecules) are placed in an electric field? 164 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER Figure 4.4 Figure 4.5 If the field is uniform, the force on the positive end, F+ = qE, exactly cancels the force on the negative end, F_ = —qE (Fig. 4.5). However, there will be a torque: N = (r+ x F+) + (r_ x F_) = [(d/2) x (<?E)] + [(-d/2) x (—<?E)] =^dxE. Thus a dipole p = q& in a uniform field E experiences a torque N = p x E. (4.4) Notice that N is in such a direction as to line p up parallel to E; a polar molecule that is free to rotate will swing around until it points in the direction of the applied field. If the field is nonuniform, so that F+ does not exactly balance F_, there will be a net force on the dipole, in addition to the torque. Of course, E must change rather abruptly for there to be significant variation in the space of one molecule, so this is not ordinarily a major consideration in discussing the behavior of dielectrics. Nevertheless, the formula for the force on a dipole in a nonuniform field is of some interest: F = F+ + F_ = q{E + - E_) = g(AE), where AE represents the difference between the field at the plus end and the field at the minus end. Assuming the dipole is very short, we may use Eq. 1.35 to approximate the small change in E x: AE x = (VE X)   d, with corresponding formulas for E y and E z. More compactly, AE = (d V)E, 4.1. POLARIZATION 165 and therefore1 F = (p V)E. (4.5) For a “perfect” dipole of infinitesimal length, Eq. 4.4 gives the torque about the center of the dipole even in a nonuniform field; about any other point N = (p x E) + (r x F). Problem 4.5 In Fig. 4.6, pj and P2 are (perfect) dipoles a distance r apart. What is the torque on pj due to P2? What is the torque on p2 due to p | ? [In each case I want the torque on the dipole about its own center. If it bothers you that the answers are not equal and opposite, see Prob. 4.29.] Figure 4.6 Figure 4.7 Problem 4.6 A (perfect) dipole p is situated a distance z above an infinite grounded conducting plane (Fig. 4.7). The dipole makes an angle 0 with the perpendicular to the plane. Find the torque on p. If the dipole is free to rotate, in what orientation will it come to rest? Problem 4.7 Show that the energy of an ideal dipole p in an electric field E is given by U = — p • E. (4.6) Problem 4.8 Show that the interaction energy of two dipoles separated by a displacement r is U= —'— -4[pi -P2-3(pi •f)(p 2- r )]. (4.7) 4;reo [Hint: use Prob. 4.7 and Eq. 3.104.] Problem 4.9 A dipole p is a distance r from a point charge q, and oriented so that p makes an angle 6 with the vector r from q to p. (a) What is the force on p? (b) What is the force on ql 1 In the present context Eq. 4.5 could be written more conveniently as F = V(p • E). However, it is safer to stick with (p • V)E, because we will be applying the formula to materials in which the dipole moment (per unit volume) is itself a function of position and this second expression would imply (incorrectly) that p too is to be differentiated. 166 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER 4.1.4 Polarization In the previous two sections we have considered the effect of an external electric field on an individual atom or molecule. We are now in a position to answer (qualitatively) the original question: What happens to a piece of dielectric material when it is placed in an electric field? If the substance consists of neutral atoms (or nonpolar molecules), the field will induce in each a tiny dipole moment, pointing in the same direction as the field.2 If the material is made up of polar molecules, each permanent dipole will experience a torque, tending to line it up along the field direction. (Random thermal motions compete with this process, so the alignment is never complete, especially at higher temperatures, and disappears almost at once when the field is removed.) Notice that these two mechanisms produce the same basic result: a lot of little dipoles pointing along the direction of the field—the material becomes polarized. A convenient measure of this effect is P = dipole moment per unit volume, which is called the polarization. From now on we shall not worry much about how the polarization got there. Actually, the two mechanisms I described are not as clear-cut as I tried to pretend. Even in polar molecules there will be some polarization by displacement (though generally it is a lot easier to rotate a molecule than to stretch it, so the second mechanism dominates). It’s even possible in some materials to “freeze in” polarization, so that it persists after the field is removed. But let’s forget for a moment about the cause of the polarization and study the field that a chunk of polarized material itself produces. Then, in Sect. 4.3, we 11 put it all together: the original field, which was responsible for P, plus the new field, which is due to P. 4.2 The Field of a Polarized Object 4.2.1 Bound Charges Suppose we have a piece of polarized material—that is, an object containing a lot of micro¬ scopic dipoles lined up. The dipole moment per unit volume P is given. Question: What is the field produced by this object (not the field that may have caused the polarization, but the field the polarization itself causes)? Well, we know what the field of an individual dipole looks like, so why not chop the material up into infinitesimal dipoles and integrate to get the total? As usual it’s easier to work with the potential. For a single dipole p we have equation (Eq. 3.99), V(r) 1 n, p 4;t6o ' t2 (4.8) In asymmetric molecules the induced dipole moment may not be parallel to the field, but if the molecules are randomly oriented, the perpendicular contributions will average to zero. Within a single crystal, the orientations are certainly not random, and we would have to treat this case separately. 4.2. THE FIELD OF A POLARIZED OBJECT 167 Figure 4.8 where n. is the vector from the dipole to the point at which we are evaluating the potential (Fig. 4.8). In the present context we have a dipole moment p = Pdr 1 in each volume element dr', so the total potential is 1 f i • P(r') , That does it, in principle. But a little sleight-of-hand casts this integral into a much more illuminating form. Observing that where (unlike Prob. 1.13) the differentiation is with respect to the source coordinates (r'), we have 47T60 J PV'U re¬ integrating by parts, using product rule number 5, gives or, using the divergence theorem, v = -L4lr .d. ---Lfl 47T€o J * 47T60 J * S V j -V)dx'. The first term looks like the potential of a surface charge 168 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER (where n is the normal unit vector), while the second term looks like the potential of a volume charge ' Pb = -V • P. (4.12) With these definitions, Eq. 4.10 becomes V(r) = J— <f da'+ - 1— f 47T60 / -4 47T60 J * 5 V — dr'. (4.13) What this means is that the potential (and hence also the field) of a polarized object is the same as that produced by a volume charge density pb = -V • P plus a surface charge density er/, = P • n. Instead of integrating the contributions of all the infinitesimal dipoles, as in Eq. 4.9, we just find those bound charges, and then calculate the fields they produce, in the same way we calculafe the field of any other volume and surface charges (for example, using Gauss’s law). Example 4.2 Find the electric field produced by a uniformly polarized sphere of radius R. Solution: We may as well choose the z axis to coincide with the direction of polarization (Fig. 4.9). The volume bound charge density pb is zero, since P is uniform, but ab — P • n = P cos 9, where 6 is the usual spherical coordinate. What we want, then, is the field produced by a charge density P cos 9 plastered over the surface of a sphere. But we have already computed the potential of such a configuration in Ex. 3.9: V(r, 9) = P -rcosd, 3eo P R3 -jr COS 9 3e0 r2 for r < R, for r > R. Figure 4.9 4.2. THE FIELD OF A POLARIZED OBJECT 169 Since r cos 6 = z, the field inside the sphere is uniform, P „ 1 E = -VV = — -—z =-P, forr < R. (4.14) 360 360 ; This remarkable result will be very useful in what follows. Outside the sphere the potential is identical to that of a perfect dipole at the origin, 1 pr V = - f orr > R, (4.15) 4^60 r2 whose dipole moment is, not surprisingly, equal to the total dipole moment of the sphere: p = ^/? 3P. (4.16) The field of the uniformly polarized sphere is shown in Fig. 4.10. Problem 4.10 A sphere of radius R carries a polarization P(r) = kr, where k is a constant and r is the vector from the center. (a) Calculate the bound charges cq, and p/,. (b) Find the field inside and outside the sphere. 170 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER Problem 4.11 A short cylinder, of radius a and length L, carries a “frozen-in” uniform polar¬ ization P, parallel to its axis. Find the bound charge, and sketch the electric field (i) for L 2 > a. (ii) for L a, and (iii) for L ~ a. [This device is known as a bar electret; it is the electrical analog to a bar magnet. In practice, only very special materials—barium titanate is the most “familiar” example—will hold a permanent electric polarization. That’s why you can’t buy electrets at the toy store.] Problem 4.12 Calculate the potential of a uniformly polarized sphere (Ex. 4.2) directly from Eq. 4.9. 4.2.2 Physical Interpretation of Bound Charges In the last section we found that the field of a polarized object is identical to the field that would be produced by a certain distribution pf “bound charges,” ep, and p/,. But this conclusion emerged in the course of abstract manipulations on the integral in Eq. 4.9, and left us with no clue as to the physical meaning of these bound charges. Indeed, some authors give you the impression that bound charges are in some sense “fictitious”—mere bookkeeping devices used to facilitate the calculation of fields. Nothing could be farther from the truth; pi, and a/, represent perfectly genuine accumulations of charge. In this section I’ll explain how polarization leads to §uch accumulations of charge. The basic idea is very simple: Suppose we have a long string of dipoles, as shown in Fig. 4.11. Along the line, the head of one effectively cancels the tail of its neighbor, but at the ends there are two charges left over: plus at the right end and minus at the left. It is as if we had peeled off an electron at one end and carried it all the way down to the other end. though in fact no single electron made the whole trip—a lot of tiny displacements add up to one large one. We call the net charge at the ends bound charge to remind ourselves that it cannot be removed; in a dielectric every electron is attached to a specific atom or molecule. But apart from that, bound charge is no different from any other kind. Figure 4-11 To calculate the actual amount of bound charge resulting from a given polarization, examine a “tube” of dielectric parallel to P. The dipole moment of the tiny chunk shown in Fig. 4.12 is P(Ad), where A is the cross-sectional area of the tube and d is the length of the chunk. In terms of the charge (q) at the end, this same dipole moment can be written qd. The bound charge that piles up at the right end of the tube is therefore q = PA. If the ends have been sliced off perpendicularly, the surface charge density is Ob 4.2. THE FIELD OF A POLARIZED OBJECT 171 A P Vlend Figure 4.12 Figure 4.13 For an oblique cut (Fig. 4.13), the charge is still the same, but A = Aend cos 0, so ai? = —— = P cos 9 = P • n. ''I end The effect of the polarization, then, is to paint a bound charge ct* = P   n over the surface of the material. This is exactly what we found by more rigorous means in Sect. 4.2.1. But now we know where the bound charge comes from. If the polarization is nonuniform we get accumulations of bound charge within the material as well as on the surface. A glance at Fig. 4.14 suggests that a diverging P results in a pileup of negative charge. Indeed, the net bound charge f pb dx in a given volume is equal and opposite to the amount that has been pushed out through the surface. The latter (by the same reasoning we used before) is P • n per unit area, so / • da = j (V -P)dx. V Since this is true for any volume, we have Pb = -v • P, confirming, again, the more rigorous conclusion of Sect. 4.2.1. Figure 4.14 172 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER Example 4.3 There is another way of analyzing the uniformly polarized sphere (Ex. 4.2), which nicely illustrates the idea of a bound charge. What we have, really, is two spheres of charge: a positive sphere and a negative sphere. Without polarization the two are superimposed and cancel completely. But when the material is uniformly polarized, all the plus charges move slightly upward (the z direction), and all the minus charges move slightly downward (Fig. 4.15). The two spheres no longer overlap perfectly: at the top there’s a “cap” of leftover positive charge and at the bottom a cap of negative charge. This “leftover” charge is precisely the bound surface charge op. Figure 4.15 In Prob. 2.18 you calculated the field in the region of overlap between two uniformly charged spheres; the answer was E =_ 4;reo R3 ’ where q is the total charge of the positive sphere, d is the vector from the negative center the positive center, and R is the radius of the sphere. We can express this in terms of the polarization of the sphere, p = q& = ( j7T/?3)P, as E = 1 -P. 3eo Meanwhile, for points outside, it is as though all the charge on each sphere were concentrated at the respective center. We have, then, a dipole, with potential 47 T60 r2 (Remember that d is some small fraction of an atomic radius; Fig. 4.15 is grossly exaggerated.) These answers agree, of course, with the results of Ex. 4.2. 4.2. THE FIELD OF A POLARIZED OBJECT 173 Problem 4.13 A very long cylinder, of radius a, carries a uniform polarization P perpendicular to its axis. Find the electric field inside the cylinder. Show that the field outside the cylinder can be expressed in the form E(r) = —~[2(P • s)s — P], 2 e0sz [Careful: I said “uniform,” not “radial”!] Problem 4.14 When you polarize a neutral dielectric, charge moves a bit, but the total remains zero. This fact should be reflected in the bound charges ot> and pp. Prove from Eqs. 4.11 and 4.12 that the total bound charge vanishes. 4.2.3 The Field Inside a Dielectric I have been sloppy about the distinction between “pure” dipoles and “physical” dipoles. In developing the theory of bound charges, I assumed we were working with the pure kind— indeed, I started with Eq. 4.8, the formula for the potential of a pure dipole. And yet, an actual polarized dielectric consists of physical dipoles, albeit extremely tiny ones. What is more, I presumed to represent discrete molecular dipoles by a continuous density function P. How can I justify this method? Outside the dielectric there is no real problem: here we are far away from the molecules (n. is many times greater than the separation distance between plus and minus charges), so the dipole potential dominates overwhelmingly and the detailed “graininess” of the source is blurred by distance. Inside the dielectric, however, we can hardly pretend to be far from all the dipoles, and the procedure I used in Sect. 4.2.1 is open to serious challenge. In fact, when you stop to think about it, the electric field inside matter must be fantas¬ tically complicated, on the microscopic level. If you happen to be very near an electron, the field is gigantic, whereas a short distance away it may be small or point in a totally different direction. Moreover, an instant later, as the atoms move about, the field will have altered entirely. This true microscopic field would be utterly impossible to calculate, nor would it be of much interest if you could. Just as, for macroscopic purposes, we regard water as a continuous fluid, ignoring its molecular structure, so also we can ignore the microscopic bumps and wrinkles in the electric field inside matter, and concentrate on the macroscopic field. This is defined as the average field over regions large enough to contain many thousands of atoms (so that the uninteresting microscopic fluctuations are smoothed over), and yet small enough to ensure that we do not wash out any significant large-scale variations in the field. (In practice, this means we must average over regions much smaller than the dimensions of the object itself.) Ordinarily, the macroscopic field is what people mean when they speak of “the” field inside matter.3 3 In case the introduction of the macroscopic field sounds suspicious to you, let me point out that you do exactly the same averaging whenever you speak of the density of a material. 174 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER / Figure 4.16 It remains to show that the macroscopic field is what we actually obtain when we use the methods of Sect. 4.2.1. The argument is subtle, so hang on. Suppose I want to calculate the macroscopic field at some point r within a dielectric (Fig. 4.16). I know I must average the true (microscopic) field over an appropriate volume, so let me draw a small sphere about r, of radius, say, a thousand times the size of a molecule. The macroscopic field at r, then, consists of two parts: the average field over the sphere due to all charges outside, plus the average due to all charges inside: E — Eout + E;n. Now you proved in Prob. 3.41(d) that the average field (over a sphere), produced b\\ charges outside, is equal to the field they produce at the center, so Eout is the field at r due to the dipoles exterior to the sphere. These are far enough away that we can safely use Eq. 4.9: 1 f i.P(r') , Voi>t=-- / -y— dr . (4.171 4tt60 J 'L outside The dipoles inside the sphere are too close to treat in this fashion. But fortunately all we need is their average field, and that, according to Eq. 3.105, is 1__P^ 47rco R3 ’ regardless of the details of the charge distribution within the sphere. The only relevant quantity is the total dipole moment, p = (^xR 3) P: E Sl (4.18) Now, by assumption the sphere is small enough that P does not vary significantly over its volume, so the term left out of the integral in Eq. 4.17 corresponds to the field at the center of a uniformly polarized sphere, to wit: —(l/3eo)P (Eq. 4.14). But this is preciseh what E;n (Eq. 4.18) puts back in! The macroscopic field, then, is given by the potential F(r) = 1 fi- P(r') 47TC0 J (4.19i 4.3. THE ELECTRIC DISPLACEMENT 175 where the integral runs over the entire volume of the dielectric. This is, of course, what we used in Sect. 4.2.1; without realizing it, we were correctly calculating the averaged, macroscopic field, for points inside the dielectric. You may have to reread the last couple of paragraphs for the argument to sink in. Notice that it all revolves around the curious fact that the average field over any sphere (due to the charge inside) is the same as the field at the center of a uniformly polarized sphere with the same total dipole moment. This means that no matter how crazy the actual microscopic charge configuration, we can replace it by a nice smooth distribution of perfect dipoles, if all we want is the macroscopic (average) field. Incidentally, while the argument ostensibly relies on the spherical shape I chose to average over, the macroscopic field is certainly independent of the geometry of the averaging region, and this is reflected in the final answer, Eq. 4.19. Presumably, one could reproduce the same argument for a cube or an ellipsoid or whatever—the calculation might be more difficult, but the conclusion would be the same. 4.3 The Electric Displacement 4.3.1 Gauss’s Law in the Presence of Dielectrics In Sect. 4.2 we found that the effect of polarization is to produce accumulations of bound charge, pb = -V   P within the dielectric and a b = P • n on the surface. The field due to polarization of the medium is just the field of this bound charge. We are now ready to put it all together: the field attributable to bound charge plus the field due to everything else (which, for want of a better term, we call free charge). The free charge might consist of electrons on a conductor or ions embedded in the dielectric material or whatever; any charge, in other words, that is not a result of polarization. Within the dielectric, then, the total charge density can be written: P = Pb + Pf, (4.20) and Gauss’s law reads e0V • E = p — p h + pf — -V • P + pf, where E is now the total field, not just that portion generated by polarization. It is convenient to combine the two divergence terms: V • (eoE + P) = pf. The expression in parentheses, designated by the letter D, D S fgE + P, is known as the electric displacement. In terms of D, Gauss’s law reads V   D = Pf, (4.21) (4.22) 176 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER or, in integral form, (j)D   da = Qfmc, (4.23) where Q /cnc denotes the total free charge enclosed in the volume. This is a particularly useful way to express Gauss’s law, in the context of dielectrics, because it makes reference only to free charges, and free charge is the stuff we control. Bound charge comes along for the ride: when we put the free charge in place, a certain polarization automatically ensues, by the mechanisms of Sect. 4.1, and this polarization produces the bound charge. In a typical problem, therefore, we know py, but we do not (initially) know p/,; Eq. 4.23 lets us go right to work with the information at hand. In particular, whenever the requisite symmetry is present, we can immediately calculate D by the standard Gauss’s law methods. Example 4.4 A long straight wire, carrying uniform line charge X, is surrounded by rubber insulation out to a radius a (Fig. 4.17). Find the electric displacement. Figure 4.17 Solution: Drawing a cylindrical Gaussian surface, of radius a- and length L, and applying Eq. 4.23, we find D(2nsL) =XL. Therefore, D=— s. (4.24) 2ns Notice that this formula holds both within the insulation and outside it. In the latter region. P = 0, so 1 X „ E = —D =- s , for s > a. e0 2ne0s Inside the rubber the electric field cannot be determined, since we do not know P. It may have appeared to you that I left out the surface bound charge ep> in deriving Eq. 4.22, and in a sense that is true. We cannot apply Gauss’s law precisely at the surface of a dielectric, for here pb blows up, taking the divergence of E with it. But everywhere else the logic is sound, and in fact if we picture the edge of the dielectric as having some finite thickness within which the polarization tapers off to zero (probably a more realistic model 4.3. THE ELECTRIC DISPLACEMENT 111 than an abrupt cut-off anyway), then there is no surface bound charge; pt, varies rapidly but smoothly within this “skin,” and Gauss’s law can be safely applied everywhere. At any rate, the integral form (Eq. 4.23) is free from this “defect.” Problem 4.15 A thick spherical shell (inner radius a, outer radius b) is made of dielectric material with a “frozen-in” polarization k „ P(r) = - r, r where k is a constant and r is the distance from the center (Fig. 4.18). (There is no free charge in the problem.) Find the electric field in all three regions by two different methods: (a) Locate all the bound charge, and use Gauss’s law (Eq. 2.13) to calculate the field it produces. (b) Use Eq. 4.23 to find D, and then get E from Eq. 4.21. [Notice that the second method is much faster, and avoids any explicit reference to the bound charges.] Problem 4.16 Suppose the field inside a large piece of dielectric is Eq, so that the electric displacement is Dq = eg Eg + P. (a) Now a small spherical cavity (Fig. 4.19a) is hollowed out of the material. Find the field at the center of the cavity in terms of E0 and P. Also find the displacement at the center of the cavity in terms of Do and P. (b) Do the same for a long needle-shaped cavity running parallel to P (Fig. 4.19b). (c) Do the same for a thin wafer-shaped cavity perpendicular to P (Fig. 4.19c). [Assume the cavities are small enough that P, Eg, and Dg are essentially uniform. Hint: Carving out a cavity is the same as superimposing an object of the same shape but opposite polarization.] (a) Sphere (b) Needle (c) Wafer Figure 4.18 Figure 4.19 178 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER 4.3.2 A Deceptive Parallel Equation 4.22 looks just like Gauss’s law, only the total charge density p is replaced by the free charge density p / , and D is substituted for f()E. For this reason, you may be tempted to conclude that D is “just like” E (apart from the factor eo), except that its source is p, instead of p: “To solve problems involving dielectrics, you just forget all about the bound charge—calculate the field as you ordinarily would, only call the answer D instead of E.\" This reasoning is seductive, but the conclusion is false; in particular, there is no “Coulomb's law” for D: The parallel between E and D is more subtle than that. For the divergence alone is insufficient to determine a vector field; you need to know the curl as well. One tends to forget this in the case of electrostatic fields because the curl of E is always zero. But the curl of D is not always zero. V x D = e0( V x E) + (V x P) = V x P, (4.251 and there is no reason, in general, to suppose that the curl of P vanishes. Sometimes it does, as in Ex. 4.4 and Prob. 4.15, but more often it does not. The bar electret of Prob. 4.11 is a case in point: here there is no free charge anywhere, so if you really believe that the onh source of D is pp, you will be forced to conclude that D = 0 everywhere, and hence that E = (— 1 /e q)P inside and E = 0 outside the electret, which is obviously wrong. (I leave it for you to find the place where V x P ^ 0 in this problem.) Because Vxl)/: 0, moreover. D cannot be expressed as the gradient of a scalar—there is no “potential” for D. Advice: When you are asked to compute the electric displacement, first look for sym¬ metry. If the problem exhibits spherical, cylindrical, or plane symmetry, then you can get D directly from Eq. 4.23 by the usual Gauss’s law methods. (Evidently in such cases V x P is automatically zero, but since symmetry alone dictates the answer you’re not really obliged to worry about the curl.) If the requisite symmetry is absent, you’ll have to think of another approach and, in particular, you must not assume that D is determined exclusively by the free charge. 4.3.3 Boundary Conditions The electrostatic boundary conditions of Sect. 2.3.5 can be recast in terms of D. Equation 4.23 fells us the discontinuity in the component perpendicular to an interface: ^aiove - ^telow = */• (4-26' while Eq. 4.25 gives the discontinuity in parallel components: nil _ nil — pH _pH 14 27) w above w below — r above r beloW (H.tn 4.4. LINEAR DIELECTRICS 179 In the presence of dielectrics these are sometimes more useful than the corresponding boundary conditions on E (Eqs. 2.31 and 2.23): £ above - £ telow = T°' (4-28) £o and E iove - Ebelow = 0- (4.29) You might try applying them, for example, to Probs. 4.16 and 4.17. Problem 4.17 For the bar electret of Prob. 4.11, make three careful sketches: one of P, one of E, and one of D. Assume L is about 2a. [Hint: E lines terminate on charges; D lines terminate on free charges.] 4.4 Linear Dielectrics 4.4.1 Susceptibility, Permittivity, Dielectric Constant In Sects. 4.2 and 4.3 we did not commit ourselves as to the cause of P; we dealt only with the effects of polarization. From the qualitative discussion of Sect. 4.1, though, we know that the polarization of a dielectric ordinarily results from an electric field, which lines up the atomic or molecular dipoles. For many substances, in fact, the polarization is proportional to the field, provided E is not too strong: P = foX.E. (4.30) The constant of proportionality, / e, is called the electric susceptibility of the medium (a factor of to has been extracted to make ye dimensionless). The value of ye depends on the microscopic structure of the substance in question (and also on external conditions such as temperature). I shall call materials that obey Eq. 4.30 linear dielectrics.4 Note that E in Eq. 4.30 is the total field; it may be due in part to free charges and in part to the polarization itself. If, for instance, we put a piece of dielectric into an external field Eo, we cannot compute P directly from Eq. 4.30; the external field will polarize the material, and this polarization will produce its own field, which then contributes to the total field, and this in turn modifies the polarization, which ... Breaking out of this infinite regress is not always easy. You’ll see some examples in a moment. The simplest approach is to begin with the displacement, at least in those cases where D can be deduced directly from the free charge distribution. 4In modern optical applications, especially, nonlinear materials have become increasingly important. For these there is a second term in the formula for P as a function of E—typically a cubic one. In general, Eq. 4.30 can be regarded as the first (nonzero) term in the Taylor expansion of P in powers of E. 180 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER In linear media we have D — eoE + P — eoE + foXeE — eo(l + Xe)E, (4.31) so D is also proportional to E: D = eE, (4.32) where f = fo(l + Xe)- (4.33) This new constant e is called the permittivity of the material. (In vacuum, where there is no matter to polarize, the susceptibility is zero, and the permittivity is eo- That’s why to is called the permittivity of free space. I dislike the term, for it suggests that the vacuum is just a special kind of linear dielectric, in which the permittivity happens to have the value 8.85 x 10“12 C 2/N-m 2.) If you remove a factor of eo, the remaining dimensionless quantity = 1 + Xe = — (4.34) £o is called the relative permittivity, or dielectric constant, of the material. Dielectric con¬ stants for some common substances are listed in Table 4.2. Of course, the permittivity and the dielectric constant do not convey any information that was not already available in the susceptibility, nor is there anything essentially new in Eq. 4.32; the physics of linear dielectrics is all contained in Eq. 4.30.5 Material Dielectric Constant Material Dielectric Constant Vacuum 1 Benzene 2.28 Helium 1.000065 Diamond 5.7 Neon 1.00013 Salt 5.9 Hydrogen 1.00025 Silicon 11.8 Argon 1.00052 Methanol 33.0 Air (dry) 1.00054 Water 80.1 Nitrogen 1.00055 Ice (-30° C) 99 Water vapor (100° C) 1.00587 KTaNb03 (0° C) 34,000 Table 4.2 Dielectric Constants (unless otherwise specified, values given are for 1 atm, 20° C).

LINEAR DIELECTRICS 181 Figure 4.20 Example 4.5 A metal sphere of radius a carries a charge Q (Fig. 4.20). It is surrounded, out to radius b, by linear dielectric material of permittivity e. Find the potential at the center (relative to infinity). Solution: To compute V, we need to know E; to find E, we might first try to locate the bound charge; we could get the bound charge from P, but we can’t calculate P unless we already know E (Eq. 4.30). We seem to be in a bind. What we do know is thcfree charge Q, and fortunately the arrangement is spherically symmetric, so let’s begin by calculating D, using Eq. 4.23: D = ^ r, for all points r > a. 4 nr1 (Inside the metal sphere, of course, E = P = D = 0.) Once we know D, it is a trivial matter to obtain E, using Eq. 4.32: E = Q 47ter2 Q 4jregr2 The potential at the center is therefore r, fora < r <b, for r > b.

ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER in the dielectric, and hence Pb = -v • P = 0, while fOXeQ 4neb 2 ’ at the outer surface. -=-, at the inner surface. I 4 nea 1 Notice that the surface bound charge at a is negative (n points outward with respect to the dielectric, which is +r at b but — f at a). This is natural, since the charge on the metal sphere attracts its opposite in all the dielectric molecules. It is this layer of negative charge that reduces the field, within the dielectric, from l/4jreo(G/r^)r to \\/4ne(Q/r 2)r. In this respect a dielectric is rather like an imperfect conductor: on a conducting shell the induced surface charge would be such as to cancel the field of Q completely in the region a < r < b: the dielectric does the best it can, but the cancellation is only partial. You might suppose that linear dielectrics would escape the defect in the parallel between E and D. Since P and D are now proportional to E, does it not follow that their curls, like E’s, must vanish? Unfortunately, it does not, for the line integral of P around a closed path that straddles the boundary between one type of material and another need not be zero, even though the integral of E around the same loop must be. The reason is that the proportionality factor eoXe is different on the two sides. For instance, at the interface between a polarized dielectric and the vacuum (Fig. 4.21), P is zero on one side but not on the other. Around this loop <f P • d\\ f 0, and hence, by Stokes’ theorem, the curl of P cannot vanish everywhere within the loop (in fact, it is infinite at the boundary). P = 0 —— Vacuum -^- Dielectric - º- P*0 Figure 4.21 Of course, if the space is entirely filled with a homogeneous6 linear dielectric, then this objection is void; in this rather special circumstance V • D — Pf and V x D = 0, so D can be found from the free charge just as though the dielectric were not there: D = foEvac> where E vac is the field the same free charge distribution would produce in the absence of any dielectric. According to Eqs. 4.32 and 4.34, therefore, E = -D = —Evac. (4.35) e er 6A homogeneous medium is one whose properties (in this case the susceptibility) do not vary with position. 4.4. LINEAR DIELECTRICS 183 Conclusion: When all space is filled with a homogeneous linear dielectric, the field every¬ where is simply reduced by a factor of one over the dielectric constant. (Actually, it is not necessary for the dielectric to fill all space: in regions where the field is zero anyway, it can hardly matter whether the dielectric is present or not, since there’s no pqlarization in any event.) For example, if a free charge q is embedded in a large dieleptric, the field it produces is E = 1 4tx€ r2 (4.36) (that’s e, not to). and the force it exerts on nearby charges is reduced accordingly. But it’s not that there is anything wrong with Coulomb’s law; rather, the polarization of the medium partially “shields” the charge, by surrounding it with bound charge of the opposite sign (Fig. 4.22).7 Figure 4.22 Example 4.6 A parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.23) is filled with insulating material of dielectric constant er. What effect does this have on its capacitance? Solution: Since the field is confined to the space between the plates, the dielectric will reduce E, and hence also the potential difference V, by a factor \\/er. Accordingly, the capacitance C = Q/V is increased by a factor of the dielectric constant, C = erC v ac. (4.37) This is, in fact, a common way to beef up a capacitor. 7In quantum electrodynamics the vacuum itself can be polarized, and this means that the effective (or “renor¬ malized”) charge of the electron, as you might measure it in the laboratory, is not its true (“bare”) value, and in fact depends slightly on how far away you are! 184 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER Figure 4.23 By the way, a crystal is generally easier to polarize in some directions than in others,8 and in this case Eq. 4.30 is replaced by the general linear relation Px — fo (XexxE x + XexyE y + XexzE z) Py — £0 (XeyxE x + XeyyE y + XeyzE z) Pz = ^0 (XezxE x + XezyE y + XezzE z) (4.38) just as Eq. 4.1 was superseded by Eq. 4.3 for asymmetrical molecules. The nine coefficients. Xexx   Xexy, • • •, constitute the susceptibility tensor. Problem 4.18 The space between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.24) is filled with two slabs of linear dielectric material. Each slab has thickness a, so the total distance between the plates is 2a. Slab 1 has a dielectric constant of 2, and slab 2 has a dielectric constant of 1.5. The free charge density on the top plate is a and on the bottom plate —a. (a) Find the electric displacement D in each slab. (b) Find the electric field E in each slab. (c) Find the polarization P in each slab. (d) Find the potential difference between the plates. (e) Find the location and amount of all bound charge. (f) Now that you know all the charge (free and bound), recalculate the field in each slab, and confirm your answer to (b). SA medium is said to be isotropic if its properties (such as susceptibility) are the same in all directions. Thus Eq. 4.30 is the special case of Eq. 4.38 that holds for isotropic media. Physicists tend to be sloppy with their language, and unless otherwise indicated the term “linear dielectric’' certainly means “isotropic linear dielectric,\" and probably means “homogeneous isotropic linear dielectric.” 4.4. LINEAR DIELECTRICS 185 Figure 4.24 Problem 4.19 Suppose you have enough linear dielectric material, of dielectric constant er, to half-fill a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.25). By what fraction is the capacitance increased when you distribute the material as in Fig. 4.25(a)? How about Fig. 4.25(b)? For a given potential difference V between the plates, find E, D, and P, in each region, and the free and bound charge on all surfaces, for both cases. (b) Figure 4.25 Problem 4.20 A sphere of linear dielectric material has embedded in it a uniform free charge density p. Find the potential at the center of the sphere (relative to infinity), if its radius is R and its dielectric constant is er. Problem 4.21 A certain coaxial cable consists of a copper wire, radius a, surrounded by a concentric copper tube of inner radius c (Fig. 4.26). The space between is partially filled (from b out to c) with material of dielectric constant er, as shown. Find the capacitance per unit length of this cable. 186 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER Figure 4.26 4.4.2 Boundary Value Problems with Linear Dielectrics In a homogeneous linear dielectric the bound charge density (pb) is proportional to the free charge density (p/):9 pb = -V • P = -V • (eoyD) = - Pf. (4.39) In particular, unless free charge is actually embedded in the material, p = 0, and any net charge must reside at the surface. Within such a dielectric, then, the potential obeys Laplace’s equation, and all the machinery of Chapter 3 carries over. It is convenient, however, to rewrite the boundary conditions in a way that makes reference only to the free charge. Equation 4.26 says £ above ^above — ebelow-Ebeiow = CT/’ (4.40) or (in terms of the potential), 9 Vabove 9 Vbelow € above 7, f below “ — O f , (4.41) On dn whereas the potential itself is, of course, continuous (Eq. 2.34): Labove -- Lbelow* (4.42) Example 4.7 A sphere of homogeneous linear dielectric material is placed in an otherwise uniform electric field Eq (Fig. 4.27). Find the electric field inside the sphere. 9This does not apply to the surface charge (ctj,), because Xe is not independent of position (obviously) at the boundary. 4.4. LINEAR DIELECTRICS 187 Solution: This is reminiscent of Ex. 3.8, in which an uncharged conducting sphere was introduced into a uniform field. In that case the field of the induced charge completely canceled Eq within the sphere; in a dielectric, the cancellation (from the bound charge) is only partial. Our problem is to solve Laplace’s equation, for Vm( r, 8) when r < R, and Vout(r, 8) when r > R, subject to the boundary conditions (i) T in = Tout, SLtr = R, 9T in 9 Tout „ (ii) 6-- dr = en-, at r = R, u dr (hi) Tout —* —EorcosS, for r R.

ELECTRIC HELDS IN MATTER But as in the case of the conducting plane, there is a nicer solution by the method of images. Indeed, if we replace the dielectric by a single point charge qj, at the image position (0, 0, —d), we have 1 V =- 47re0 _£_ \\A 2 + y2 + (z - d)2 + _ 4b_ y* 2+ y2 + (z + d)2 (4.52) in the region z > 0. Meanwhile, a charge (q + qC at (0, 0, d) yields the potential 1 47reo q + qb six2 4- y2 + (z - d)2 (4.53) for the region z < 0. Taken together, Eqs. 4.52 and 4.53 constitute a function which satisfies Poisson’s equation with a point charge q at (0, 0, d), which goes to zero at infinity, which is continuous at the boundary z = 0, and whose normal derivative exhibits the discontinuity appropriate to a surface charge aj, at z = 0: dV \\ =_ 1 / Xe \\ _ qd_ z= 0+ dz z=o~) 2jt \\Xe + 2/ (x2 + y2 + d2)2/2 Accordingly, this is the correct potential for our problem. In particular, the force on q is: Xe Xe + 2 i qqb - 1 - _2 —- 4jz€q (2d)2 4jz€q Ad2 (4.54) / 3V 1 dz I do not claim to have provided a compelling motivation for Eqs. 4.52 and 4.53—like all image solutions, this one owes its justification to the fact that it works: it solves Poisson's equation, and it meets the boundary conditions. Still, discovering an image solution is not entirely a matter of guesswork. There are at least two “rules of the game”: (1) You must never put an image charge into the region where you’re computing the potential. (Thus Eq. 4.52 gives the potential for z > 0, but this image charge qi, is at z = — d; when we turn to the region z < 0 (Eq. 4.53), the image charge (q + qC is at z = +d .) (2) The image charges must add up to the correct total in each region. (That’s how I knew to use qt, to account for the charge in the region z < 0, and (q + q^) to cover the region z > 0.) Problem 4.22 A very long cylinder of linear dielectric material is placed in an otherwise uniform electric field Eq. Find the resulting field within the cylinder. (The radius is a, the susceptibility Xe, and the axis is perpendicular to Eq.) Problem 4.23 Find the field inside a sphere of linear dielectric material in an otherwise uniform electric field Eq (Ex. 4.7) by the following method of successive approximations: First pretend the field inside is just Eg, and use Eq. 4.30 to write down the resulting polarization Pg. This polarization generates a field of its own, Ei (Ex. 4.2), which in turn modifies the polarization by an amount Pi, which further changes the field by an amount Ej, and so on. The resulting field is Eg + Ej + Ej +   • •. Sum the series, and compare your answer with Eq. 4.49. Problem 4.24 An uncharged conducting sphere of radius a is coated with a thick insulating shell (dielectric constant er) out to radius b. This object is now placed in an otherwise uniform electric field Eg. Find the electric field in the insulator. 4.4. LINEAR DIELECTRICS 191 Problem 4.25 Suppose the region above the xy plane in Ex. 4.8 is also filled with linear dielectric but of a different susceptibility x'e  Find the potential everywhere. 4.4.3 Energy in Dielectric Systems It takes work to charge up a capacitor (Eq. 2.55): W = \\ CV2. If the capacitor is filled with linear dielectric, its capacitance exceeds the vacuum value by a factor of the dielectric constant, C = 6j-Cvac> as we found in Ex. 4.6. Evidently the work necessary to charge a dielectric-filled capacitor is increased by the same factor. The reason is pretty clear: you have to pump on more (free) charge to achieve a given potential, because part of the field is canceled off by the bound charges. In Chapter 2,1 derived a general formula for the energy stored in any electrostatic system (Eq. 2.45): IT = y J E2 dr. (4.55) The case of the dielectric-filled capacitor suggests that this should be changed to IT = y j erE 2d x = ^J D-Edr, in the presence of linear dielectrics. To prove it, suppose the dielectric material is fixed in position, and we bring in the free charge, a bit at a time. As pf is increased by an amount App, the polarization will change and with it the bound charge distribution; but we’re interested only in the work done on the incremental free charge: AW = J(Ap f )Vdr. (4.56) Since V • D = pp, Ap/ = V • (AD), where AD is the resulting change in D, so / AIT = / [V (AD)]Tdr. Now V • [(AD)T] = [V • (AD)]T + AD   (VT), and hence (integrating by parts):  / AW = V   [(AD)V] dr + / (AD) • Edr. /< 192 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER The divergence theorem turns the first term into a surface integral, which vanishes if we integrate over all of space. Therefore, the work done is equal to AW = f (AD) • Edr. (4.57) So far, this applies to any material. Now, if the medium is a linear dielectric, then D = eE, so 3 A(D • E) = ±A(eE2) = e(AE) • E = (AD) • E (for infinitesimal increments). Thus AW = A^j D • Edr The total work done, then, as we build the free charge up from zero to the final configuration, is j D • Edr, (4.58) as anticipated.12 It may puzzle you that Eq. 4.55, which we derived quite generally in Chapter 2, does not seem to apply in the presence of dielectrics, where it is replaced by Eq. 4.58. The point is not that one or the other of these equations is wrong, but rather that they speak to somewhat different questions. The distinction is subtle, so let’s go right back to the beginning: What do we mean by “the energy of a system”? Answer: It is the work required to assemble the system. Very well—but when dielectrics are involved there are two quite different ways one might construe this process: (1) We bring in all the charges (free and bound), one by one, with tweezers, and glue each one down in its proper final location. If this is what you mean by “assemble the system,” the Eq. 4.55 is your formula for the energy stored. Notice, however, that this will not include the work involved in stretching and twisting the dielectric molecules (if we picture the positive and negative charges as held together by tiny springs, it does not include the spring energy, ^kx2, associated with polarizing each molecule).13 (2) With the unpolarized dielectric in place, we bring in the free charges, one by one, allowing the dielectric to respond as it sees fit. If this is what you mean by “assemble the system\" (and ordinarily it is, since free charge is what we actually push around), then Eq. 4.58 is the formula you want. In this case the “spring” energy is included, albeit indirectly, because the force you must apply to the free charge depends on the disposition of the bound charge; as you move the free charge you are automatically stretching those “springs.” To put it another 12In ease you are wondering why I did not do this more simply by the method of Sect. 2.4.3, starting with W = j f pfVd r, the reason is that this formula is untrue, in general. Study the derivation of Eq. 2.42 and you will see that it applies only to the total charge. For linear dielectrics it happens to hold for the free charge alone, but this is scarcely obvious a priori and, in fact, is most easily confirmed by working backward from Eq. 4.58. 13The “spring” itself may be electrical in nature, but it is still not included in Eq. 4.55, if E is taken to be the macroscopic field. 4.4. LINEAR DIELECTRICS 193 way, in method (2) the total energy of the system consists of three parts: the electrostatic energy of the free charge, the electrostatic energy of the bound charge, and the “spring” energy: Wtot = Wfree + Abound + ^spring- The last two are equal and opposite (in procedure (2) the bound charges are always in equilibrium, and hence the net work done on them is zero); thus method (2), in calculating VTfree, actually delivers Wtot, whereas method (1), by calculating Wfree+Abound, leaves out ^spring- Incidentally, it is sometimes alleged that Eq. 4.58 represents the energy even for nonlinear dielectrics, but this is false: To proceed beyond Eq. 4.57 one must assume linearity. In fact, for dissipative systems the whole notion of “stored energy” loses its meaning, because the work done depends not only on the final configuration but on how it got there. If the molec¬ ular “springs” are allowed to have some friction, for instance, then VTspring can be made as large as you like, by assembling the charges in such a way that the spring is obliged to expand and contract many times before reaching its final state. In particular, you get nonsensical results if you try to apply Eq. 4.58 to electrets, with frozen-in polarization (see Prob. 4.27). Problem 4.26 A spherical conductor, of radius a, carries a charge Q (Fig. 4.29). It is surrounded by linear dielectric material of susceptibility Xe, out to radius b. Find the energy of this configuration (Eq. 4.58). / a \"A Figure 4.29 Problem 4.27 Calculate W, using both Eq. 4.55 and Eq. 4.58, for a sphere of radius R with frozen-in uniform polarization P (Ex. 4.2). Comment on the discrepancy. Which (if either) is the “true” energy of the system? 4.4.4 Forces on Dielectrics Just as a conductor is attracted into an electric field (Eq. 2.51), so too is a dielectric—and for essentially the same reason: the bound charge tends to accumulate near the free charge of the opposite sign. But the calculation of forces on dielectrics can be surprisingly tricky. Dielectric Figure 4.30 Consider, for example, the case of a slab of linear dielectric material, partially inserted between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 4.30). We have always pretended that the field is uniform inside a parallel-plate capacitor, and zero outside. If this were literally true, there would be no net force on the dielectric at all, since the field everywhere would be perpendicular to the plates. However, there is in reality a fringing field around the edges, which for most purposes can be ignored but in this case is responsible for the whole effect. (Indeed, the field could not terminate abruptly at the edge of the capacitor, for if it did the line integral of E around the closed loop shown in Fig. 4.31 would not be zero.) It is this nonuniform fringing field that pulls the dielectric into the capacitor. Fringing fields are notoriously difficult to calculate; luckily, we can avoid this altogether, by the following ingenious method. Let W be the energy of the system—it depends, of course, on the amount of overlap. If I pull the dielectric out an infinitesimal distance dx. the energy is changed by an amount equal to the work done: dW = F me dx, (4.59) 4.4. LINEAR DIELECTRICS 195 Figure 4.31 where E me is the force I must exert, to counteract the electrical force F on the dielectric: Fme = — F. Thus the electrical force on the slab is F dW dx (4.60) Now, the energy stored in the capacitor is W = \\CV 2 (4.61) and the capacitance in this case is C = ——(erl - Xex), (4.62) d where / is the length of the plates (Fig. 4.30). Let’s assume that the total charge on the plates (Q — CV) is held constant, as the dielectric moves. In terms of Q, so But and hence 1 Qz W = - — 2 C dW _ IQ 2 dC _ 1 y2d C dx 2 C2 dx 2 dx dC _ epXeW dx d = _ € QXeW 2 (4.63) (4.64) 2d (4.65) 196 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER (The minus sign indicates that the force is in the negative x direction; the dielectric is pulled into the capacitor.) It is a common error to use Eq. 4.61 (with V constant), rather than Eq. 4.63 (with Q constant), in computing the force. One then obtains F = 1 2d C -V 2 —, 2 dx which is off by a sign. It is, of course, possible to maintain the capacitor at a fixed potential, by connecting it up to a battery. But in that case the battery also does work as the dielectric moves; instead of Eq. 4.59, we now have dW — F me dx + V dQ, (4.66) where V dQ is the work done by the battery. It follows that F dW dx dQ 1 2d C + V-=   = --v — + v dx dx , dC dx 1 2d C -V 2 —, 2 dx (4.67) the same as before (Eq. 4.64), with the correct sign. (Please understand, the force on the dielectric cannot possibly depend on whether you plan to hold Q constant or V constant—it is determined entirely by the distribution of charge, free and bound. It’s simpler to calculate the force assuming constant Q, because then you don’t have to worry about work done by the battery; but if you insist, it can be done correctly either way.) Notice that we were able to determine the force without knowing anything about the fringing fields that are ultimately responsible for it! Of course, it’s built into the whole structure of electrostatics that V x E = 0, and hence that the fringing fields must be present; we’re not really getting something for nothing here—just cleverly exploiting the internal consistency of the theory. The energy stored in the fringing fields themselves (which was not accounted for in this derivation) stays constant, as the slab moves; what does change is the energy well inside the capacitor, where the field is nice and uniform. Problem 4.28 Two long coaxial cylindrical metal tubes (inner radius a, outer radius b) stand vertically in a tank of dielectric oil (susceptibility / e, mass density p). The inner one is maintained at potential V, and the outer one is grounded (Fig. 4.32). To what height (h) does the oil rise in the space between the tubes? 4.4.

Check this claim, as follows: (a) Write down the formula for the proposed potential V(r), in terms of Vp, R, and r. Use it to determine the field, the polarization, the bound charge, and the free charge distribution on the sphere. (b) Show that the total charge configuration would indeed produce the potential V(r ). (c) Appeal to the uniqueness theorem in Prob. 4.35 to complete the argument.

Figure 4.36 Problem 4.37 According to Eq. 4.5, the force on a single dipole is (p • V)E, so the net force on a dielectric object is F = /(P.V)Eextdr. (4.69) [Flere Eext is the field of everything except the dielectric. You might assume that it wouldn’t matter if you used the total field; after all, the dielectric can’t exert a force on itself. Flowever, because the field of the dielectric is discontinuous at the location of any bound surface charge, the derivative introduces a spurious delta function, and you must either add a compensating surface term, or (better) stick with Eext, which suffers no such discontinuity.] Use Eq. 4.69 to determine the force on a tiny sphere of radius R, composed of linear dielectric material of susceptibility Xe, which is situated a distance j from a fine wire carrying a uniform line charge A. 200 CHAPTER 4. ELECTRIC FIELDS IN MATTER Problem 4.38 In a linear dielectric, the polarization is proportional to the field: P = eq/eE. If the material consists of atoms (or nonpolar molecules), the induced dipole moment of each one is likewise proportional to the field p = aE. Question: What is the relation between the atomic polarizability a and the susceptibility /<.? Since P (the dipole moment per unit volume) is p (the dipole moment per atom) times N (the number of atoms per unit volume), P = Np = NaE, one’s first inclination is to say that Na Xe =- • (4.70) And in fact this is not far off, if the density is low. But closer inspection reveals a subtle problem, for the field E in Eq. 4.30 is the total macroscopic field in the medium, whereas the field in Eq. 4.1 is due to everything except the particular atom under consideration (polarizability was defined for an isolated atom subject to a specified external field); call this field E e]se. Imagine that the space allotted tq each atom is a sphere of radius R, and show that Use this to conclude that or E=(l-^)E else. (4.71) Xe Na/e o 1 — Na/3eo 3eq {€r — 1 N \\e r+ 2 )   (4'72) Equation 4.72 is known as the Clausius-Mossotti formula, or, in its application to optics, the Lorentz-Lorenz equation. Problem 4.39 Check the Clausius-Mossotti relation (Eq. 4.72) for the gases listed in Table 4.1. (Dielectric constants are given in Table 4.2.) (The densities here are so small that Eqs. 4.70 and 4.72 are indistinguishable. For experimental data that confirm the Clausius-Mossotti correction term see, for instance, the first edition of Purcell’s Electricity and Magnetism, Problem 9.28.)14 Problem 4.40 The Clausius-Mossotti equation (Prob. 4.38) tells you how to calculate the susceptibility of a nonpolar substance, in terms of the atomic polarizability a. The Langevin equation tells you how to calculate the susceptibility of a polar substance, in terms of the permanent molecular dipole moment p. Here’s how it goes: (a) The energy of a dipole in an external field E is u = —p • E (Eq. 4.6); it ranges from —pE to +pE, depending on the orientation. Statistical mechanics says that for a material in equilibrium at absolute temperature T, the probability of a given molecule having energy u is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. exp(—u/kT). The average energy of the dipoles is therefore jue-WWdu / e~^ kTUu 14 E. M. Purcell, Electricity and Magnetism (Berkeley Physics Course, Vol. 2), (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1963). 4.4. LINEAR DIELECTRICS 201 where the integrals run from —pE to +pE. Use this to show that the polarization of a substance containing N molecules per unit volume is P = Np[coMpE/kT) - (kT/pE)]. (4.73) That’s the Langevin formula. Sketch P/Np as a function of pE/kT. (b) Notice that for large fields/low temperatures, virtually all the molecules are lined up, and the material is nonlinear. Ordinarily, however, kT is much greater than pE. Show that in this regime the material is linear, and calculate its susceptibility, in terms of N. p, T. and k. Compute the susceptibility of water at 20° C, and compare the experimental value in Table 4.2. (The dipole moment of water is 6.1 x 10-30 C-m.) This is rather far off, because we have again neglected the distinction between E and E eise. The agreement is better in low-density gases, for which the difference between E and E eise is negligible. Try it for water vapor at 100° and 1 atm. Chapter 5 Magnetostatics 5.1 The Lorentz Force Law 5.1.1 Magnetic Fields Remember the basic problem of classical electrodynamics: We have a collection of charges q\\, q2, <73, ... (the “source” charges), and we want to calculate the force they exert on some other charge Q (the “test” charge). (See Fig. 5.1.) According to the principle of superposition, it is sufficient to find the force of a single source charge—the total is then the vector sum of all the individual forces. Up to now we have confined our attention to the simplest case, electrostatics, in which the source charge is at rest (though the test charge need not be). The time has come to consider the forces between charges in motion. <h Q <h Source charges Test charge Figure 5.1 To give you some sense of what is in store, imagine that I set up the following demon¬ stration: Two wires hang from the ceiling, a few centimeters apart; when I turn on a current, so that it passes up one wire and back down the other, the wires jump apart—they evidently, repel one another (Fig. 5.2(a)). How do you explain this? Well, you might suppose that the battery (or whatever drives the current) is actually charging up the wire, and that the force is simply due to the electrical repulsion of like charges. But this explanation is in¬ correct. I could hold up a test charge near these wires and there would be no force on it. 202 5.1. THE LORENTZ FORCE LAW 203 (a) Currents in opposite directions repel. (b) Currents in same directions attract. Figure 5.2 for the wires are in fact electrically neutral. (It’s true that electrons are flowing down the line—that’s what a current is—but there are just as many stationary plus charges as moving minus charges on any given segment.) Moreover, I could hook up my demonstration so as to make the current flow up both wires (Fig. 5.2(b)); in this case they are found to attract! Whatever force accounts for the attraction of parallel currents and the repulsion of antiparallel ones is not electrostatic in nature. It is our first encounter with a magnetic force. Whereas a stationary charge produces only an electric field E in the space around it, a moving charge generates, in addition, a magnetic field B. In fact, magnetic fields are a lot easier to detect, in practice—all you need is a Boy Scout compass. How these devices work is irrelevant at the moment; it is enough to know that the needle points in the direction of the local magnetic field. Ordinarily, this means north, in response to the earth's magnetic field, but in the laboratory, where typical fields may be hundreds of times stronger than that, the compass indicates the direction of whatever magnetic field is present. Now, if you hold up a tiny compass in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire, you quickly discover a very peculiar thing: The field does not point toward the wire, nor away from it, but rather it circles around the wire. In fact, if you grab the wire with your right 204 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS I / v Wire 1 Wire 2 Figure 5.4 hand—thumb in the direction of the current—your fingers curl around in the direction of the magnetic field (Fig. 5.3). Flow can such a field lead to a force of attraction on a nearby parallel current? At the second wire the magnetic field points into the page (Fig. 5.4), the velocity of the charges is upward, and yet the resulting force is to the left. It’s going to take a strange law to account for these directions! I’ll introduce this law in the next section. Later on, in Sect. 5.2, we’ll return to what is logically the prior question: How do you calculate the magnetic field of the first wire? 5.1.2 Magnetic Forces It may have occurred to you that the combination of directions in Fig. 5.4 is just right for a cross product. In fact, the magnetic force in a charge Q, moving with velocity v in a magnetic field B, is1 Fmag = Q(\\ X B). (5.1l This is known as the Lorentz force law. In the presence of both electric and magnetic fields, the net force on Q would be F = Q[E + (v x B)]. (5.2) I do not pretend to have derived Eq. 5.1, of course; it is a fundamental axiom of the theory, whose justification is to be found in experiments such as the one I described in Sect. 5.1.1. Our main job from now on is to calculate the magnetic field B (and for that matter the electric field E as well, for the rules are more complicated when the source charges are in motion). But before we proceed, it is worthwhile to take a closer look at the Lorentz force law itself; it is a peculiar law, and it leads to some truly bizarre particle trajectories. 1 Since F and v are vectors, B is actually a pseudovector. 5.1. THE LORENTZ FORCE LAW 205 Example 5.1 Cyclotron motion The archetypical motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field is circular, with the magnetic force providing the centripetal acceleration. In Fig. 5.5, a uniform magnetic field points into the page; if the charge Q moves counterclockwise, with speed v. around a circle of radius R. the magnetic force (5.1) points inward, and has a fixed magnitude QvB—just right to sustain uniform circular motion: u2 QvB = m —, or p = QBR, (5.3) K where m is the particle’s mass and p = mv is its momentum. Equation 5.3 is known as the cyclotron formula because it describes the motion of a particle in a cyclotron—the first of the modem particle accelerators. It also suggests a simple experimental technique for finding the momentum of a particle: send it through a region of known magnetic field, and measure the radius of its circular trajectory. This is in fact the standard means for determining the momenta of elementary particles. Incidentally, I assumed that the charge moves in a plane perpendicular to B. If it starts out with some additional speed u|| parallel to B, this component of the motion is unaffected by the magnetic field, and the particle moves in a helix (Fig. 5.6). The radius is still given by Eq. 5.3, but the velocity in question is now the component perpendicular to B, u_|_. Example 5.2 Cycloid Motion A more exotic trajectory occurs if we include a uniform electric field, at right angles to the magnetic one. Suppose, for instance, that B points in the ^-direction, and E in the z-direction, as shown in Fig. 5.7. A particle at rest is released from the origin; what path will it follow? Solution: Let’s think it through qualitatively, first. Initially, the particle is at rest, so the magnetic force is zero, and the electric field accelerates the charge in the z-direction. As it picks up speed, a magnetic force develops which, according to Eq. 5.1, pulls the charge around 206 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS Figure 5.7 to the right. The faster it goes, the stronger F mag becomes; eventually, it curves the particle back around towards the y axis. At this point the charge is moving against the electrical force, so it begins to slow down—the magnetic force then decreases, and the electrical force takes over, bringing the charge to rest at point a, in Fig. 5.7. There the entire process commences anew, carrying the particle over to point b, and so on. Now let’s do it quantitatively. There being no force in the x-direction, the position of the particle at any time t can be described by the vector (0 , y(t), z(t)); the velocity is therefore V = (0, y,z), where dots indicate time derivatives. Thus v x B = x y 0 y = Bzy - Byi, BOO and hence, applying Newton’s second law, F = Q( E + vxB)= Q(E i + Bzy — Byi) = ma = m(y y + zz). Or, treating the y and z components separately, QBz = my, QE — QBy = mi. For convenience, let to = QB (5.4) m (This is the cyclotron frequency, at which the particle would revolve in the absence of an\\ electric field.) Then the equations of motion take the form Their general solution2 is y(t) = C) coswt + C2 sinwr + (E/B)t + C3, z(t) = C2C 0 S wt — C{ sinwr + C4. (5.6) 2As coupled differential equations, they are easily solved by differentiating the first and using the second to eliminate z. 5.1. THE LORENTZ FORCE LAW 207 But the particle started from rest (y(0) = z(0) = 0), at the origin (_y(0) = z(0) = 0); these four conditions determine the constants C\\, C^, C3, and C4: E E y(t) =—~(a>t— sin a>t), z(t) = — ( 1- c oscot). (5 .7 ) a>B coB In this form the answer is not terribly enlightening, but if we let (5.8) and eliminate the sines and cosines by exploiting the trigonometric identity sin2 cot +cos2 cot = 1, we find that (y ~ Ran)2 + (z - R)2 = R2. (5.9) This is the formula for a circle, of radius R, whose center (0, Rcot, R) travels in the y-direction at a constant speed, (5.10) The particle moves as though it were a spot on the rim of a wheel, rolling down the y axis at speed v. The curve generated in this way is called a cycloid. Notice that the overall motion is not in the direction of E, as you might suppose, but perpendicular to it. One feature of the magnetic force law (Eq. 5.1) warrants special attention: Magnetic forces do no work. For if Q moves an amount d\\ ~ v dt, the work done is — F mag • d\\ — Q(y x B) • vd t — 0. (5.11) This follows because (v x B) is perpendicular to v, so (v x B) • v = 0. Magnetic forces may alter the direction in which a particle moves, but they cannot speed it up or slow it down. The fact that magnetic forces do no work is an elementary and direct consequence of the Lorentz force law, but there are many situations in which it appears so manifestly false that one’s confidence is bound to waver. When a magnetic crane lifts the carcass of a junked car, for instance, something is obviously doing work, and it seems perverse to deny that the magnetic force is responsible. Well, perverse or pot, deny it we must, and it can be a very subtle matter to figure out what agency does deserve the credit in such circumstances. I’ll show you several examples as we go along. Problem 5.1 A particle of charge q enters a region of uniform magnetic field B (pointing into the page). The field deflects the particle a distance d above the original line of flight, as shown in Fig. 5.8. Is the charge positive or negative? In terms of a, d, B and q, find the momentum of the particle. Problem 5.2 Find and sketch the trajectory of the particle in Ex. 5.2, if it starts at the origin with velocity (a) v(0) = (E/B)y, (b) v(0) = (E/2B)j, (c) v(0) = (E/B)(y + z). 208 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS Problem 5.3 In 1897 J. J. Thomson “discovered” the electron by measuring the charge-to-mass ratio of “cathode rays” (actually, streams of electrons, with charge q and mass m) as follows: (a) First he passed the beam through uniform crossed electric and magnetic fields E and B (mutually perpendicular, and both of them perpendicular to the beam), and adjusted the electric field until he got zero deflection. What, then, was the speed of the particles (in terms of E and B)I (b) Then he turned off the electric field, and measured the radius of curvature, R, of the beam, as deflected by the magnetic field alone. In terms of E, B, and R, what is the charge-to-mass ratio (q/m) of the particles? 5.1.3 Currents The current in a wire is the charge per unit time passing a given point. By definition, negative charges moving to the left count the same as positive ones to the right. This conveniently reflects the physical fact that almost all phenomena involving moving charges depend on the product of charge and velocity—if you change the sign of q and v, you get the same answer, so it doesn’t really matter which you have. (The Lorentz force lavs is a case in point; the Hall effect (Prob. 5.39) is a notorious exception.) In practice, it is ordinarily the negatively charged electrons that do the moving—in the direction opposite the electric current. To avoid the petty complications this entails, I shall often pretend it's the positive charges that move, as in fact everyone assumed they did for a century or so after Benjamin Franklin established his unfortunate convention.3 Current is measured in coulombs-per-second, or amperes (A): 1 A = 1 C/s. (5.12) A line charge A traveling down a wire at speed v (Fig. 5.9) constitutes a current / = An, (5.13) because a segment of length vAt, carrying charge An At, passes point P in a time interval At. Current is actually a vector: I = Av; (5.14) 3If we called the electron plus and the proton minus, the problem would never arise. In the context of Franklin'' experiments with cat’s fur and glass rods, the choice was completely arbitrary. 5.1. THE LORENTZ FORCE LAW 209 Figure 5.9 since the path of the flow is dictated by the shape of the wire, most people don’t bother to display the vectorial character of I explicitly, but when it comes to surface and volume currents we cannot afford to be so casual, and for the sake of notational consistency it is a good idea to acknowledge this right from the start. A neutral wire, of course, contains as many stationary positive charges as mobile negative ones. The former do not contribute to the current—the charge density X in Eq. 5.13 refers only to the moving charges. In the unusual situation where both types move, I = a + v + + A_v_. The magnetic force on a segment of current-carrying wire is evidently Fmag — / (txB)^ = j (v x B)A dl = j (lx B) dl. (5.15) Inasmuch as I and dl both point in the same direction, we can just as well write this as (5.16) Fmag — f I (d\\ X B). Typically, the current is constant (in magnitude) along the wire, and in that case / comes outside the integral: Fmag — 1 J (dl x B). (5.17) Example 5.3 A rectangular loop of wire, supporting a mass m, hangs vertically with one end in a uniform magnetic field B, which points into the page in the shaded region of Fig. 5.10. For what current 7, in the loop, would the magnetic force upward exactly balance the gravitational force downward? Solution: First of all, the current must circulate clockwise, in order for (I x B) in the horizontal segment to point upward. The force is Fmag — I Ba, where a is the width of the loop. (The magnetic forces on the two vertical segments cancel.) For F mag to balance the weight (mg), we must therefore have j = mg Ba The weight just hangs there, suspended in mid-air! (5.18) 210 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS Figure 5.10 What happens if we now increase the current? Then the upward magnetic force exceeds the downward force of gravity, and the loop rises, lifting the weight. Somebody’s doing work, and it sure looks as though the magnetic force is responsible. Indeed, one is tempted to write Wmag = F mngh = IBah, (5.19) where h is the distance the loop rises. But we know that magnetic forces never do work. What’s going on here? Well, when the loop starts to rise, the charges in the wire are no longer moving horizontally— their velocity now acquires an upward component u, the speed of the loop (Fig. 5.11), in addition to the horizontal component w associated with the current (/ = Aw). The magnetic force, which is always perpendicular to the velocity, no longer points straight up, but tilts back. It is perpendicular to the net displacement of the charge (which is in the direction of v), and therefore it does no work on q. It does have a vertical component (qwB)\\ indeed, the net vertical force on all the charge (ka) in the upper segment of the loop is F vert = kawB = I Ba (5.201 (as before); but now it also has a horizontal component (quB ), which opposes the flow of current. Whoever is in charge of maintaining that current, therefore, must now push those charges along, against the backward component of the magnetic force. quB Figure 5.11 5.1. THE LORENTZ FORCE LAW 211 The total horizontal force on the top segment is evidently ^horiz = YauB. (5.21) In a time dt the charges move a (horizontal) distance w dt, so the work done by this agency (presumably a battery or a generator) is ^battery = YaB / uw dt = I Bah, which is precisely what we naively attributed to the magnetic force in Eq. 5.19. Was work done in this process? Absolutely! Who did it? The battery! What, then, was the role of the magnetic force? Well, it redirected the horizontal force of the battery into the vertical motion of the loop and the weight. It may help to consider a mechanical analogy. Imagine you ’re pushing a trunk up a frictionless ramp, by pushing on it horizontally with a mop (Fig. 5.12). The normal force (N) does no work, because it is perpendicular to the displacement. But it does have a vertical component (which in fact is what lifts the trunk), and a (backward) horizontal component (which you have to overcome by pushing on the mop). Who is doing the work here? You are, obviously—and yet your force (which is purely horizontal) is not (at least, not directly) what lifts the box. The normal force plays the same passive (but crucial) role as the magnetic force in Ex. 5.3: while doing no work itself, it redirects the efforts of the active agent (you, or the battery, as the case may be), from horizontal to vertical. When charge flows over a surface, we describe it by the surface current density, K, defined as follows: Consider a “ribbon” of infinitesimal width dl±, running parallel to the flow (Fig. 5.13). If the current in this ribbon is dl, the surface current density is d\\ dl± (5.22) In words, K is the current per unit width-perpendicular-to-flow. In particular, if the (mobile) surface charge density is a and its velocity is v, then K = crv. (5.23) In general, K will vary from point to point over the surface, reflecting variations in a and/or v. The magnetic force on the surface current is Fmag = f (\\ x B)ct da = f (K x B) da. (5.24) 212 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS Figure 5.13 Caveat: Just as E suffers a discontinuity at a surface charge, so B is discontinuous at a surface current. In Eq. 5.24, you must be careful to use the average field, just as we did in Sect. 2.5.3. When the flow of charge is distributed throughout a three-dimensional region, we de¬ scribe it by the volume current density, J, defined as follows: Consider a “tube” of infinitesimal cross section daj_, running parallel to the flow (Fig. 5.14). If the current in this tube is dl, the volume current density is d\\ da± (5.25) In words, J is the current per unit area-perpendicular-to-flow. If the (mobile) volume charge density is p and the velocity is v, then J = pv. The magnetic force on a volume current is therefore Fmag = / (\\ x R)p dr = J(J x B) dr. (5.26) (5.27) Figure 5.14 5.1. THE LORENTZ FORCE LAW 213 Figure 5.15 Example 5.4 (a) A current I is uniformly distributed over a wire of circular cross section, with radius a (Fig. 5.15). Find the volume current density 7. Solution: The area-perpendicular-to-flow is ntp-. so 7 = -L na A This was trivial because the current density was uniform. (b) Suppose the current density in the wire is proportional to the distance from the axis, 7 = ks (for some constant k). Find the total current in the wire. Solution: Because 7 varies with s, we must integrate Eq. 5.25. The current in the shaded patch (Fig. 5.16) is 7<7aj_, anddaj_ = sdsdtf). So, /p a '2.7ikcr> (ks)(s ds dtp) = Ink J ds = —-—. According to Eq. 5.25, the current crossing a surface S can be written as 1=1 J da± = / J-da. (5.28) Js Js (The dot product serves neatly to pick out the appropriate component of da.) In particular, the total charge per unit time leaving a volume V is ® J • da = I (V • J) dr. Js Jv 214 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS Because charge is conserved, whatever flows out through the surface must come at the expense of that remaining inside: L(v•j >i ‘=-sX'‘'i~ / v(£)‘'r- (The minus sign reflects the fact that an outward flow decreases the charge left in V.) Since this applies to any volume, we conclude that (5.29) This is the precise mathematical statement of local charge conservation; it is called the continuity equation. For future reference, let me summarize the “dictionary” we have implicitly developed for translating equations into the forms appropriate to point, line, surface, and volume currents: This correspondence, which is analogous to q ~ X dl ~ a da ~ p dr for the various charge distributions, generates Eqs. 5.15, 5.24, and 5.27 from the original Lorentz force law (5.1). Problem 5.4 Suppose that the magnetic field in some region has the form B = kzx (where A: is a constant). Find the force on a square loop (side a), lying in the yz plane and centered at the origin, if it carries a current /, flowing counterclockwise, when you look down the x axis. Problem 5.5 A current I flows down a wire of radius a. (a) If it is uniformly distributed over the surface, what is the surface current density K1 (b) If it is distributed in such a way that the volume current density is inversely proportional to the distance from the axis, what is 7? Problem 5.6 (a) A phonograph record carries a uniform density of “static electricity” a. If it rotates at angular velocity w, what is the surface current density K at a distance r from the center? (b) A uniformly charged solid sphere, of radius R and total charge Q, is centered at the origin and spinning at a constant angular velocity a> about the z axis. Find the current density J at any point (r, 9, (p) within the sphere. Problem 5.7 For a configuration of charges and currents confined within a volume V, show that I Jdr = dip/dt, JV where p is the total dipole moment. [Hint: evaluate /y V • (xj) dr .] 5.2. THE BIOT-SAVART LAW 215 5.2 The Biot-Savart Law 5.2.1 Steady Currents Stationary charges produce electric fields that are constant in time; hence the term electro¬ statics.4 Steady currents produce magnetic fields that are constant in time; the theory of steady currents is called magnetostatics. Stationary charges => constant electric fields: electrostatics. Steady currents => constant magnetic fields: magnetostatics. By steady current I mean a continuous flow that has been going on forever, with¬ out change and without charge piling up anywhere. (Some people call them “stationary currents”; to my ear, that’s a contradiction in terms.) Of course, there’s no such thing in practice as a truly steady current, any more than there is a truly stationary charge. In this sense both electrostatics and magnetostatics describe artificial worlds that exist only in textbooks. However, they represent suitable approximations as long as the actual fluctua¬ tions are reasonably slow; in fact, for most purposes magnetostatics applies very well to household currents, which alternate 60 times a second! Notice that a moving point charge cannot possibly constitute a steady current. If it’s here one instant, it’s gone the next. This may seem like a minor thing to you, but it’s a major headache for me. I developed each topic in electrostatics by starting out with the simple case of a point charge at rest; then I generalized to an arbitrary charge distribution by invoking the superposition principle. This approach is not open to us in magnetostatics because a moving point charge does not produce a static field in the first place. We are forced to deal with extended current distributions, right from the start, and as a result the arguments are bound to be more cumbersome. When a steady current flows in a wire, its magnitude / must be the same all along the line; otherwise, charge would be piling up somewhere, and it wouldn’t be a steady current. By the same token, dp/dt = 0 in magnetostatics, and hence the continuity equation (5.29) becomes VJ = 0. (5.31) 5.2.2 The Magnetic Field of a Steady Current The magnetic field of a steady line current is given by the Biot-Savart law: B(r) _ Mo f 4n J po f dl’ x i 4 n J *2 *• (5.32) 4Actually, it is not necessary that the charges be stationary, but only that the charge density at each point be constant. For example, the sphere in Prob. 5.6b produces an electrostatic field l/4jreo(G/r2)r, even though it is rotating, because p does not depend on t. 216 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS The integration is along the current path, in the direction of the flow; dl' is an element of length along the wire, and 4, as always, is the vector from the source to the point r (Fig. 5.17). The constant no is called the permeability of free space:5 no = 47T x 10-7 N/A 2. (5.33) These units are such that B itself comes out in newtons per ampere-meter (as required by the Lorentz force law), or teslas (T):6 1 T = 1 N/(A • m). (5.34) As the starting point for magnetostatics, the Biot-Savart law plays a role analogous to Coulomb’s law in electrostatics. Indeed, the 1 /-J-2 dependence is common to both laws. Example 5.5 h Find the magnetic field a distance .v from a long straight wire carrying a steady current / i! (Fig. 5.18). Solution: In the diagram, (dl' x i) points out of the page, and has the magnitude dl' sin a = dl' cos A Also, l' = s tan$, so dl' = —^— dd, cos1 6 and v = -2-cos0 , so 1 cos2 9 5 This is an exact number, not an empirical constant. It serves (via Eq. 5.37) to define the ampere, and the ampere in turn defines the coulomb. 6For some reason, in this one case the cgs unit (the gauss) is more commonly used than the SI unit: 1 tesla = 104 gauss. The earth’s magnetic field is about half a gauss; a fairly strong laboratory magnetic field is, say, 10,000 gauss. 5.2 THE BIOT-SAVART LAW 217 Figure 5.18 Thus (5.35) Equation 5.35 gives the field of any straight segment of wire, in terms of the initial and final angles 9\\ and 62 (Fig. 5.19). Of course, a finite segment by itself could never support a steady current (where would the charge go when it got to the end?), but it might be a piece of some closed circuit, and Eq. 5.35 would then represent its contribution to the total field. In the case of an infinite wire, 6\\ = —n/2 and 62 = n/ 2 , so we obtain MO 1 2ns (5.36) Notice that the field is inversely proportional to the distance from the wire—just like the electric field of an infinite line charge. In the region below the wire, B points into the page, and in general, it “circles around” the wire, in accordance with the right-hand rule stated earlier (Fig. 5.3). , i' As an application, let’s find the force of attraction between two long, parallel wires a distance !' d apart, carrying currents I\\ and I 2 (Fig. 5.20). The field at (2) due to (1) is B=^, 2nd and it points into the page. The Lorentz force law (in the form appropriate to line currents, Eq. 5.17) predicts a force directed towards (1), of magnitude f-, 3(§ 7 )/  \"  The total force, not surprisingly, is infinite, but the force per unit length is f _ MO hh 2n d (5.37) 218 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS h h (1) (2) Figure 5.20 If the currents are antiparallel (one up, one down), the force is repulsive—consistent again with the qualitative observations in Sect. 5.1.1. Example 5.6 Find the magnetic field a distance z above the center of a circular loop of radius R, which carries a steady current / (Fig. 5.21). Figure 5.21 Solution: The field dB attributable to the segment d\\' points as shown. As we integrate d\\' around the loop, dB sweeps out a cone. The horizontal components cancel, and the vertical components combine to give un f dl’ B(z) = — -I / cos0. 4jt J <2.2 (Notice that dl' and i are perpendicular, in this case; the factor of cos 0 projects out the vertical component.) Now, cos 0 and -J-2 are constants, and f dl' is simply the Circumference, 2n R, so B(z) = lipl An 2nR = no I R2 2 (R2+ Z 2) 3/2' (5.38) 5.2 THE BIOT-SAVART LAW 219 For surface and volume currents the Biot-Savart law becomes - £ / K(r') x i da and B(r) _ EO f 47T J J(r') x i dr'. (5.39) respectively. You might be tempted to write down the corresponding formula for a moving point charge, using the “dictionary” 5.30: Mo qv x n. 47T nr (5.40) but this is simply wrong,7 As I mentioned earlier, a point charge does not constitute a steady current, and the Biot-Savart law, which only holds for steady currents, does not correctly determine its field. Incidentally, the superposition principle applies to magnetic fields just as it does to electric fields: If you have a collection of source currents, the net field is the (vector) sum of the fields due to each of them taken separately. Problem 5.8 (a) Find the magnetic field at the center of a square loop, which carries a steady current I. Let R be the distance from center to side (Fig. 5.22). (b) Find the field at the center of a regular /;-sided polygon, carrying a steady current I. Again, let R be the distance from the center to any side. (c) Check that your formula reduces to the field at the center of a circular loop, in the limit n oo. Problem 5.9 Find the magnetic field at point P for each of the steady current configurations shown in Fig. 5.23. 7I say this loud and clear to emphasize the point of principle; actually, Eq. 5.40 is approximately right for nonrelativistic charges (v <5C c), under conditions where retardation can be neglected (see Ex. 10.4). 220 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS I (a) Figure 5.24 Problem 5.10 (a) Find the force on a square loop placed as shown in Fig. 5.24(a), near an infinite straight wire. Both the loop and the wire carry a steady current I. (b) Find the force on the triangular loop in Fig. 5.24(b). Problem 5.11 Find the magnetic field at point P on the axis of a tightly wound solenoid (helical coil) consisting of n turns per unit length wrapped around a cylindrical tube of radius a and carrying current / (Fig. 5.25). Express your answer in terms of 0] and 62 (it’s easiest that way). Consider the turns to be essentially circular, and use the result of Ex. 5.6. What is the field on the axis of an infinite solenoid (infinite in both directions)? A X d  u  u Figure 5.26 Problem 5.12 Suppose you have two infinite straight line charges A, a distance d apart, moving along at a constant speed v (Fig. 5.26). How great would v have to be in order for the magnetic attraction to balance the electrical repulsion? Work out the actual number... Is this a reasonable sort of speed?8 sIf you’ve studied special relativity, you may be tempted to look for complexities in this problem that are not really there—X and v are both measured in the laboratory frame, and this is ordinary electrostatics (see footnote 4). 5.3. THE DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF B 221 5.3 The Divergence and Curl of B 5.3.1 Straight-Line Currents The magnetic field of an infinite straight wire is shown in Fig. 5.27 (the current is coming out of the page). At a glance, it is clear that this field has a nonzero curl (something you’ll never see in an electrostatic field); let’s calculate it. According to Eq. 5.36, the integral of B around a circular path of radius s, centered at the wire, is B dl= <fi—dl = — l dl = im>I- J 2ns 2ns J Notice that the answer is independent of s; that’s because B decreases at the same rate as the circumference increases. In fact, it doesn’t have to be a circle; any old loop that encloses the wire would give the same answer. For if we use cylindrical coordinates (s, <p. z), with the current flowing along the z axis, B = BO I 7 2ns<f>' and dl = ds s + s d(p 4> + dz z, so B • d\\ 2n J s 2n J0 d<f> — fi0I . (5.41) This assumes the loop encircles the wire exactly once; if it went around twice, the <p would run from 0 to An, and if it didn’t enclose the wire at all, then <p would go from <fi\\ to <p2 and back again, with f d(f> — 0 (Fig. 5.28). 222 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS h Now suppose we have a bundle of straight wires. Each wire that passes through our loop contributes /iqI , and those outside contribute nothing (Fig. 5.29). The line integral will then be (£> B • d\\ — jXQ7 enc7 (5.42) where 7enc stands for the total current enclosed by the integration path. If the flow of charge is represented by a volume current density J, the enclosed current is / J • da, (5.43) with the integral taken over the surface bounded by the loop. Applying Stokes’ theorem to Eq. 5.42, then, J (V x B) • da = jXQ J J • da, and hence V x B = no J. (5.44) With minimal labor we have actually obtained the general formula for the curl of B. But our derivation is seriously flawed by the restriction to infinite straight line currents (and combinations thereof). Most current configurations cannot be constructed out of infinite straight wires, and we have no right to assume that Eq. 5.44 applies to them. So the next section is devoted to the formal derivation of the divergence and curl of B, starting from the Biot-Savart law itself. 5.3.2 The Divergence and Curl of B The Biot-Savart law for the general case of a volume current reads 5.3. THE DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF B 223 4 4 / (X, y, z) I Figure 5.30 This formula gives the magnetic field at a point r = (x,y,z) in terms of an integral over the current distribution J(x', y', z!) (Fig. 5.30). It is best to be absolutely explicit at this stage: B is a function of (x, y, z), J is a function of (x , y', z'), * = (X - x') x + (y - y') y + (z - z') z, dr' — dx' dy' dz!. The integration is over the primed coordinates; the divergence and the curl are to be taken with respect to the unprimed coordinates. Applying the divergence to Eq. 5.45, we obtain: V • B = — [ V- 4jt J T 4 J X — dr'. Invoking product rule number (6), V • • (V x J) - J • ( V x — (5.46) (5.47) But V x J — 0, because J doesn t depend on the unpnmed variables (x, y. z.). whereas V x (-i/'j.2) = 0 (Prob. 1.62), so V • B = 0. (5.48) Evidently, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. Applying the curl to Eq. 5.45, we obtain: VxB=^ j Vx|jx^J dr'. (5.49) Again, our strategy is to expand the integrand, using the appropriate product rule—in this case number 8: 224 CHAPTER 5, MAGNETOSTATICS (I have dropped terms involving derivatives of J, because J does not depend on x,y,z.) The second term integrates to zero, as we’ll see in the next paragraph. The first term involves the divergence we were at pains to calculate in Chapter 1 (Eq. 1.100): (5.51) Thus VxB=^ j J(r')4;r<53(r - r') dr' = /z 0J(r), which confirms that Eq. 5.44 is not restricted to straight-line currents, but holds quite generally in magnetostatics. To complete the argument, however, we must check that the second term in Eq. 5.50 integrates to zero. Because the derivative acts only on i/i 2, we can switch from V to V' at the cost of a minus sign:9 -(J-V)4 = (J.V')4. (5.521 The x component, in particular, is (J • V') = V' • (x - x') _ 1 J (V' • J) (using product rule 5). Now, for steady currents the divergence of J is zero (Eq. 5.31), so n -(J- VW = V'• X (x - x') ' n? J and therefore this contribution to the integral (5.49) can be written l V' • (x - x') _ 43 Js l 3 (5.53i (The reason for switching from V to V' was precisely to permit this integration by parts, i But what region are we integrating over? Well, it’s the volume that appears in the Biot- Savart law (5.45)—large enough, that is, to include all the current. You can make it bigger than that, if you like; J = 0 out there anyway, so it will add nothing to the integral. The essential point is that on the boundary the current is zero (all current is safely inside) and hence the surface integral (5.53) vanishes.10 ®The point here is that <4 depends only on the difference between the coordinates, and (3/3x)f(x — x') = -(3/3 x')f(x -x'). 10If J itself extends to infinity (as in the case of an infinite straight wire), the Surface integral is still typically zero, though the analysis calls for greater care. 5.3. THE DIVERGENCE AND CURL OFB 225 5.3.3 Applications of Ampere’s Law The equation for the curl of B V x B = moJ, (5.54) is called Ampere’s law (in differential form). It can be converted to integral form by the usual device of applying one of the fundamental theorems—in this case Stokes’ theorem: /(VxBMa = B dl MO / J • da. Now, J J • da is the total current passing through the surface (Fig. 5.31), which we call / enc (the current enclosed by the amperian loop). Thus   dl = MO^enc- (5.55) This is the integral version of Ampere’s law; it generalizes Eq. 5.42 to arbitrary steady currents. Notice that Eq. 5.55 inherits the sign ambiguity of Stokes’ theorem (Sect. 1.3.5): Which way around the loop am I supposed to go? And which direction through the surface corresponds to a “positive” current? The resolution, as always, is the right-hand rule: If the fingers of your right hand indicate the direction of integration around the boundary, then your thumb defines the direction of a positive current. Boundary line Figure 5.31 Just as the Biot-Savart law plays a role in magnetostatics that Coulomb’s law assumed in electrostatics, so Ampere’s plays the role of Gauss’s: Electrostatics : Coulomb —» Gauss, Magnetostatics: Biot —Savart —» Ampere. In particular, for currents with appropriate symmetry, Ampere’s law in integral form offers a lovely and extraordinarily efficient means for calculating the magnetic field. 226 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS Example 5.7 Find the magnetic field a distance s from a long straight wire (Fig. 5.32), carrying a steady current I (the same problem we solved in Ex. 5.5, using the Biot-Savart law). Solution: We know the direction of B is “circumferential,” circling around the wire as indicated by the right hand rule. By symmetry, the magnitude of B is constant around an amperian loop of radius s, centered on the wire. So Ampere’s law gives B • dl = B (f) dl = Bins = Mo4nc = Bof or b = \"L. 2 ns This is the same answer we got before (Eq. 5.36), but it was obtained this time with far less effort. Figure 5.33 Example 5.8 Find the magnetic field of an infinite uniform surface current K = K x, flowing over the xv plane (Fig. 5.33). Solution: First of all, what is the direction of B? Could it have any x-component? No: A glance at the Biot-Savart law (5.39) reveals that B is perpendicular to K. Could it have a z-component? No again. You could confirm this by noting that any vertical contribution from a filament at +y is canceled by the corresponding filament at -y. But there is a nicer argument: Suppose the field pointed away from the plane. By reversing the direction of the current, I could make it point toward the plane (in the Biot-Savart law, changing the sign of the current switches the sign of the field). But the z-component of B cannot possibly depend on the direction of the current in the xy plane. (Think about it!) So B can only have a v-componcnt. and a quick check with your right hand should convince you that it points to the left above the plane and to the right below it. 5.3. THE DIVERGENCE AND CURL OFB 221 With this in mind we draw a rectangular amperian loop as shown in Fig. 5.33, parallel to the yz plane and extending an equal distance above and below the surface. Applying Ampere’s law, we find i B • d\\ = 26/ = fiohi IiqKI. (one 6/ comes from the top segment, and the other from the bottom), so 6 = (p,q/2)K, or, more precisely, + (H0/2)Ky for z < 0, ([io/2)Ky for z > 0 Notice that the field is independent of the distance from the plane, just like the electric field of a uniform surface charge (Ex. 2.4). Example 5.9 Find the magnetic field of a very long solenoid, consisting of n closely wound turns per unit length on a cylinder of radius R and carrying a steady current 7 (Fig. 5.34). [The point of making the windings so close is that one can then pretend each turn is circular. If this troubles you (after all, there is a net current / in the direction of the solenoid’s axis, no matter how tight the winding), picture instead a sheet of aluminum foil wrapped around the cylinder, carrying the equivalent uniform surface current K = nl (Fig. 5.35). Or make a double winding, going up to one end and then—always in the same sense—going back down again, thereby eliminating the net longitudinal current. But, in truth, this is all unnecessary fastidiousness, for the field inside a solenoid is huge (relatively speaking), and the field of the longitudinal current is at most a tiny refinement.] Solution: First of all, what is the direction of B? Could it have a radial component? No. For suppose Bs were positive', if we reversed the direction of the current, Bs would then be negative. But switching / is physically equivalent to turning the solenoid upside down, and ;> K Figure 5.34 Figure 5.35 228 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS Figure 5.36 Figure 5.37 that certainly should not alter the radial field. How about a “circumferential” component? No. For B^ would be constant around an amperian loop concentric with the solenoid (Fig. 5.36). and hence (j) B   dl = B(p(27Ts) = noEnc = 6 , since the loop encloses no current. So the magnetic field of an infinite, closely wound solenoid runs parallel to the axis. From the right hand rule, we expect that it points upward inside the solenoid and downward outside. Moreover, it certainly approaches zero as you go very far away. With this in mind, let's apply Ampere’s law to the two rectangular loops in Fig. 5.37. Loop 1 lies entirely outside the solenoid, with its sides at distances a and b from the axis: B dl = [B(a) - B(b)]L = no4 nc = 0, so B(a) = B(b). Evidently the field outside does not depend on the distance from the axis. But we know that it goes to zero for large j. It must therefore be zero everywhere! (This astonishing result can also be derived from the Biot-Savart law, of course, but it’s much more difficult. See Prob. 5.44.) As for loop 2, which is half inside and half outside, Ampere’s law gives > B • d\\ = BL = noE\\ = nonlL, where B is the field inside the solenoid. (The right side of the loop contributes nothing, since B = 0 out there.) Conclusion: g_{ M onlz, inside the solenoid, { 0 , outside the solenoid. ^ Notice that the field inside is uniform-, in this sense the solenoid is to magnetostatics what the parallel-plate capacitor is to electrostatics: a simple device for producing strong uniform fields. 5.3. THE DIVERGENCE AND CURL OFB 229 Like Gauss’s law, Ampere’s law is always true (for steady currents), but it is not always useful. Only when the symmetry of the problem enables you to pull B outside the integral jf B   dl can you calculate the magnetic field from Ampere’s law. When it does work, it’s by far the fastest method; when it doesn’t, you have to fall back on the Biot-Savart law. The current configurations that can be handled by Ampere’s law are 1. Infinite straight lines (prototype: Ex. 5.7). 2. Infinite planes (prototype: Ex. 5.8). 3. Infinite solenoids (prototype: Ex. 5.9). 4. Toroids (prototype: Ex. 5.10). The last of these is a surprising and elegant application of Ampere’s law; it is treated in the following example. As in Exs. 5.8 and 5.9, the hard part is figuring out the direction of the field (which we will now have done, once and for all, for each of the four geometries); the actual application of Ampere’s law takes only one line. Example 5.10 A toroidal coil consists of a circular ring, or “donut,” around which a long wire is wrapped (Fig. 5.38). The winding is uniform and tight enough so that each turn can be considered a closed loop. The cross-sectional shape of the coil is immaterial. I made it rectangular in Fig. 5.38 for the sake of simplicity, but it could just as well be circular or even some weird asymmetrical form, as in Fig. 5.39, just as long as the shape remains the same all the way around the ring. In that case it follows that the magnetic field of the toroid is circumferential at all points, both inside and outside the coil. Proof: According to the Biot-Savart law, the field at r due to the current element at r' is dB = MO I x* lt, Art We may as well put r in the xz plane (Fig. 5.39), so its Cartesian components are (x, 0, z), while the source coordinates are r' = {s' cosfi', s' sin <p', z')- Then tl= (x — s' cos (f)', —s' sin <f>', z — z'). Since the current has no <p component, I = Is s + l z z, or (in Cartesian coordinates) I = (I s cos <j>', I s sin <p', I z). 230 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS Figure 5.39 Accordingly, Ixt = x y Z Is cos <p' I s sin tp' l z (x — s'costp') (—s'smtp') (z — z') = [sin4 >'{Is( z ~ z') +s'/ z)]x + [Iz( x — s' cost p') - I s cos <p'(z - z')]y + [~I sx sin^Z] z. But there is a symmetrically situated current element at r\", with the same s', the same the same dl', the same I s, and the same Iz, but negative <j>' (Fig. 5.39). Because sirup' change-- sign, the x and z contributions from r' and r\" cancel, leaving only a y term. Thus the field at r is in the y direction, and in general the field points in the $ direction, qed Now that we know the field is circumferential, determining its magnitude is ridiculoush easy. Just apply Ampere’s law to a circle of radius j about the axis of the toroid: B2tt s — HoEnc* and hence B(r) = MO N11 2jts for points inside the coil, for points outside the coil, where N is the total number of turns. 5.3. THE DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF B 231 Problem 5.13 A steady current I flows down a long cylindrical wire of radius a (Fig. 5.40). Find the magnetic field, both inside and outside the wire, if (a) The current is uniformly distributed over the outside surface of the wire.

MAGNETOSTATICS Problem 5.17 Show that the magnetic field of an infinite solenoid runs parallel to the axis. regardless of the cross-sectional shape of the coil, as long as that shape is constant along the length of the solenoid. What is the magnitude of the field, inside and outside of such a coil? Show that the toroid field (5.58) reduces to the solenoid field, when the radius of the donut is so large that a segment can be considered essentially straight. Problem 5.18 In calculating the current enclosed by an amperian loop, one must, in general, evaluate an integral of the form lenc = / J   da. JS The trouble is, there are infinitely many surfaces that share the same boundary line. Which one are we supposed to use? 5.3.4 Comparison of Magnetostatics and Electrostatics The divergence and curl of the electrostatic field are V • E = — p, (Gauss’s law); eo V x E = 0, (no name). These are Maxwell’s equations for electrostatics. Together with the boundary condition E -> 0 far from all charges, Maxwell’s equations determine the field, if the source charge density p is given; they contain essentially the same information as Coulomb’s law plus the principle of superposition. The divergence and curl of the magnetostatic field are IV • B = 0, (no name); V x B = /roJ, (Ampere’s law). These are Maxwell’s equations for magnetostatics. Again, together with the boundary condition B -> 0 far from all currents, Maxwell’s equations determine the magnetic field: they are equivalent to the Biot-Savart law (plus superposition). Maxwell’s equations and the force law F = Q(E + v x B) constitute the most elegant formulation of electrostatics and magnetostatics. The electric field diverges away from a (positive) charge; the magnetic field line curls around a current (Fig. 5.44). Electric field lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative ones; magnetic field lines do not begin or end anywhere—to do so would require a nonzero divergence. They either form closed loops or extend out to infinity. To put it another way, there are no point sources for B, as there are for E; there exists no magnetic analog to electric charge. This is the physical content of the statement V   B = 0. Coulomb and others believed that magnetism was produced by magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles, as we would now call them), and in some older books you will still 5.3. THE DIVERGENCE AND CURL OF B 233 (a) Electrostatic field of a point charge (b) Magnetostatic field of a long wire Figure 5.44 find references to a magnetic version of Coulomb’s law, giving the force of attraction or repulsion between them. It was Ampere who first speculated that all magnetic effects are attributable to electric charges in motion (currents). As far as we know, Ampere was right; nevertheless, it remains an open experimental question whether magnetic monopoles exist in nature (they are obviously pretty rare, or somebody would have found one12), and in fact some recent elementary particle theories require them. For our purposes, though, B is divergenceless and there are no magnetic monopoles. It takes a moving electric charge to produce a magnetic field, and it takes another moving electric charge to “feel” a magnetic field. Typically, electric forces are enormously larger than magnetic ones. That’s not some¬ thing you can tell from the theory as such; it has to do with the sizes of the fundamental constants eo and no. In general, it is only when both the source charges and the test charge are moving at velocities comparable to the speed of light that the magnetic force approaches the electric force in strength. (Problems 5.12 and 5.16 illustrate this rule.) How is it, then, that we ever notice magnetic effects at all? The answer is that both in the production of a magnetic field (Biot-Savdrt) and in its detection (Lorentz) it is the current (charge times velocity) that enters, and we can compensate for a smallish velocity by pouring huge quan¬ tities of charge down the wire. Ordinarily, this charge would simultaneously generate so large an electric force as to swamp the magnetic one. But if we arrange to keep the wire neutral, by embedding in it an equal amount of opposite charge at rest, the electric field cancels out, leaving the magnetic field to stand alone. It sounds very elaborate, but of course this is precisely what happens in an ordinary current carrying wire. ,2An apparent detection (B. Cabrera, Phys. Rev. Lett. 48, 1378 (1982)) has never been reproduced—andnotfor want of trying. For a delightful brief history of ideas about magnetism, see Chapter 1 in D. C. Mattis, The Theory of Magnetism (New York: Harper and Row, 1965). 234 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS Problem 5.19 (a) Find the density p of mobile charges in a piece of copper, assuming each atom contributes one free electron. [Look up the necessary physical constants.] (b) Calculate the average electron velocity in a copper wire 1 mm in diameter, carrying a current of 1 A. [Note: this is literally a snail’s pace, flow, then, can you carry on a long distance telephone conversation?] (c) What is the force of attraction between two such wires, 1 cm apart? (d) If you could somehow remove the stationary positive ions, what would the electrical repulsion force be? How many times greater than the magnetic force is it? Problem 5.20 Is Ampere’s law consistent with the general rule (Eq. 1.46) that divergence-of- curl is always zero? Show that Ampere’s law cannot be valid, in general, outside magneto¬ statics. Is there any such “defect” in the other three Maxwell equations? Problem 5.21 Suppose there did exist magnetic monopoles. How would you modify Maxwell’s equations and the force law, to accommodate them? If you think there are several plausible options, list them, and suggest how you might decide experimentally which one is right. 5.4 Magnetic Vector Potential 5.4.1 The Vector Potential fust as V x E = 0 permitted us to introduce a scalar potential (V) in electrostatics, E = -VE, so V • B = 0 invites the introduction of a vector potential A in magnetostatics: B = V x A. (5.59) The former is authorized by Theorem 1 (of Sect. 1.6.2), the latter by Theorem 2 (the proof of Theorem 2 is; developed in Prob. 5.30). The potential formulation automatically takes care of V • B = 0 (since the divergence of a curl is always zero); there remains Ampere’s law: VxB = Vx(VxA) = V(V   A) - V2A = p, 0J. (5.60) Now, the electric potential had a built-in ambiguity: you can add to V any function whose gradient is zero (which is to say, any constant), without altering the physical quantity E. Likewise, you can add to the magnetic potential any function whose curl vanishes (which is to say, the gradient of any scalar), with no effect on B. We can exploit this freedom to eliminate the divergence of A: V   A = 0. (5.61) 5.4. MAGNETIC VECTOR POTENTIAL 235 To prove that this is always possible, suppose that our original potential, A0, is not divergenceless. If we add to it the gradient of X (A = A0 + VX), the new divergence is V • A = V • A0 + V2k. We can accommodate Eq. 5.61, then, if a function X can be found that satisfies V2k = -V • A0. But this is mathematically identical to Poisson’s equation (2.24), <?o’ with V-A 0 in place of p/fq as the “source.” And we know how to solve Poisson’s equation— that’s what electrostatics is all about (“given the charge distribution, find the potential”). In particular, if p goes to zero at infinity, the solution is Eq. 2.29: V = —f — dr', 47T€o J 4 and by the same token, if V • A0 goes to zero at infinity, then V-Aq n. dr'. If V • A0 does not go to zero at infinity, we’ll have to use other means to discover the appropriate /., just as we get the electric potential by other means when the charge distribu¬ tion extends to infinity. But the essential point remains: It is always possible to make the vector potential divergenceless. To put it the other way around: The definition B = V x A specifies the curl of A, but it doesn’t say anything about the divergence—we are at liberty to pick that as we see fit, and zero is ordinarily the simplest choice. With this condition on A, Ampere’s law (5.60) becomes V2A = -noJ. (5.62) This again is nothing but Poisson’s equation—or rather, it is three Poisson’s equations, one for each Cartesian13 component. Assuming J goes to zero at infinity, we can read off the solution: , Mo A(r) = — J<r,) ar'. 4 n J n. (5.63) 13In Cartesian coordinates, V2A = (V2At )x + (V2Av)y + (V2Az)z, so Eq. 5.62 reduces to V2A„ = -/i 0J x, ^ 2Ay = and V2AZ = In curvilinear coordinates the unit vectors themselves are functions of posidon, and must be differentiated, so it is not the case, for example, that V2 Ar = —/iQjr. The safest way to calculate the Laplacian of a vector, in terms of its curvilinear components, is to use V2A = V(V-A) — V x (V x A). Remember also that even if you calculate integrals such as 5.63 using curvilinear coordinates, you must first express J in terms of its Cartesian components (see Sect. 1.4.1). 236 CHAPTER 5. MAGNETOSTATICS For line and surface currents, » = A = — f 4jt J n. An J n. An J r— I -da’. n. (5.64) (If the current does not go to zero at infinity, we have to find other ways to get A; some of these are explored in Ex. 5.12 and in the problems at the end of the section.) It must be said that A is not as useful as V. For one thing, it’s still a vector, and although Eqs. 5.63 and 5.64 are somewhat easier to work with than the Biot-Savart law, you still have to fuss with components. It would be nice if we could get away with a scalar potential, B = -Vt/, (5.65) but this is incompatible with Ampere’s law, since the curl of a gradient is always zero. (A magnetostatic scalar potential can be used, if you stick scrupulously to simply-connected, current-free regions, but as a theoretical tool it is of limited interest. See Prob. 5.28.) More¬ over, since magnetic forces do no work, A does not admit a simple physical interpretation in terms of potential energy per unit charge. (In some contexts it can be interpreted as momentum per unit charge.14) Nevertheless, the vector potential has substantial theoretical importance, as we shall see in Chapter 10. Example 5.11 A spherical shell, of radius R, carrying a uniform surface charge a, is set spinning at angular velocity co. Find the vector potential it produces at point r (Fig. 5.45). Solution: It might seem natural to align the polar axis along co, but in fact the integration is easier if we let r lie on the z axis, so that co is tilted at an angle f. We may as well orient the x axis so that co lies in the xz plane, as shown in Fig. 5.46. According to Eq. 5.64, MO /‘K(r') , A<r) = te( Figure 5.45 Figure 5.46 l4M. D. Semon and J. R. Taylor, Am. J.

MAGNETOSTATICS Example 5.12 Find the vector potential of an infinite solenoid with n turns per unit length, radius R, and current I. Solution: This time we cannot use Eq. 5.64, since the current itself extends to infinity. But here’s a cute method that does the job. Notice that •dl = J (V x A) • da J B • da = <b, (5.69) where <t> is the flux of B through the loop in question. This is reminiscent of Ampere’s law in the integral form (5.55), <f> B • d\\ = fiQlenc- In fact, it’s the same equation, with B —>  A and fioTnc -»   <!>. If symmetry permits, we can determine A from <t> in the same way we got B from /cnc. in Sect. 5.3.3. The present problem (with a uniform longitudinal magnetic field fiQnl inside the solenoid and no field outside) is analogous to the Ampere’s law problem of a fat wire carrying a uniformly distributed current. The vector potential is “circumferential” (it mimics the magnetic field of the wire); using a circular “amperian loop” at radius .s inside the solenoid, we have <£> A • dl = A(2tts) = J B • da = fiQnl (ns2), so A=l ^y-s$, for s<R. (5.70) For an amperian loop outside the solenoid, the flux is J B • da = fignlinR 2), since the field only extends out to R. Thus A = j.iqhI Rl If you have any doubts about this answer, check it: we’re done. for s > R. (5.71) Does V x A = B? Does V • A = 0? If so. Typically, the direction of A will mimic the direction of the current. For instance, both were azimuthal in Exs. 5.11 and 5.12. Indeed, if all the current flows in one direction, then Eq. 5.63 suggests that A must point that way too. Thus the potential of a finite segment of straight wire (Prob. 5.22) is in the direction of the current. Of course, if the current extends to infinity you can’t use Eq. 5.63 in the first place (see Probs. 5.25 and 5.26). Moreover, you can always add an arbitrary constant vector to A—this is analogous to changing the reference point for V, and it won’t affect the divergence or curl of A, which is all that matters (in Eq. 5.63 we have chosen the constant so that A goes to zero at infinity). In principle you could even use a vector potential that is not divergenceless, in which case all bets are off. Despite all these caveats, the essential point remains: Ordinarily the direction of A will match the direction of the current. 5.4. MAGNETIC VECTOR POTENTIAL 239 Problem 5.22 Find the magnetic vector potential of a finite segment of straight wire, carrying a current I. [Put the wire on the z axis, from z\\ to Z2, and use Eq. 5.64.] Check that your answer is consistent with Eq. 5.35. Problem 5.23 What current density would produce the vector potential, A = k(j> (where k is a constant), in cylindrical coordinates? Problem 5.24 If B is uniform, show that A(r) = -j(r x B) works. That is, check that V • A = 0 and V x A = B. Is this result unique, or are there other functions with the same divergence and curl? Problem 5.25 (a) By whatever means you can think of (short of looking it up), find the vector potential a distance ^ from an infinite straight wire carrying a current I. Check that V • A = 0 and V x A = B. (b) Find the magnetic potential inside the wire, if it has radius R and the current is uniformly distributed.

(b) Check that Eq. 5.63 is consistent with Eq. 5.45, by applying the curl. (c) Check that Eq. 5.63 is consistent with Eq. 5.62, by applying the Laplacian. Problem 5.28 Suppose you want to define a magnetic scalar potential U (Eq. 5.65), in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire. First of all, you must stay away from the wire itself (there V x B A 0); but that’s not enough. Show, by applying Ampere’s law to a path that starts at a and circles the wire, returning to |) (Fig. 5.47), that the scalar potential cannot be single-valued (that is, (/(a) / U(b), even jf they represent the same physical point). As an example, find the scalar potential for an infinite straight wire. (To avoid a multivalued potential, you must restrict yourself to simply-connected regions that remain on one side or the other of every wire, never allowing you to go all the way around.)

Problem 5.30 (a) Complete the proof of Theorem 2, Sect. 1.6.2. That is, show that any divergenceless vector field F can be written as the curl of a vector potential A. What you have to do is find Ax, Ay. and Az such that: (i) dAz/dy — dAy/dz = F x; (ii) dAx/ dz — dAz/dx = F y; and (iii) 3Ay/‘dx — dAx/ dy = F z. Here’s one way to do it: Pick Ax = 0, and solve (ii) and (iii) for Ay and Az. Note that the “constants of integration” here are themselves functions of y and z—they’re constant only with respect to x. Now plug these expressions into (i), and use the fact that V • F = 0 to obtain px py px Ay = I F z(x\\y,z)dx l; Az = I F x(0, y', z) dy' - I F y(x',y , z) dx'. Jo Jo Jo (b) By direct differentiation, check that the A you obtained in part (a) satisfies V x A = F. Is A divergenceless? [This was a very asymmetrical construction, and it would be surprising if it were—although we know that there exists a vector whose curl is F and whose divergence is zero.] (c) As an example, let F = y x + z y + x z. Calculate A, and confirm that V x A = F. (For further discussion see Prob. 5.51.) 5.4.2 Summary; Magnetostatic Boundary Conditions In Chapter 2, I drew a triangular diagram to summarize the relations among the three fundamental quantities of electrostatics: the charge density p, the electric field E, and the potential V. A similar diagram can be constructed for magnetostatics (Fig. 5.48), relating Figure 5.48 5.4. MAGNETIC VECTOR POTENTIAL 241 the current density J, the field B, and the potential A. There is one “missing link” in the diagram, the equation for A in terms of B. It’s unlikely you would ever need such a formula, but in case you are interested, see Probs. 5.50 and 5.51. Just as the electric field suffers a discontinuity at a surface charge, so the magnetic field is discontinuous at a surface current. Only this time it is the tangential component that changes. For if we apply Eq. 5.48, in the integral form B • da = 0, to a wafer-thin pillbox straddling the surface (Fig. 5.49), we get d-L _ d-L ^ above 0 below (5.72) As for the tangential components, an amperian loop running perpendicular to the current (Fig. 5.50) yields / B -dl = (<, ve - g^ low)/ = /xo/enc = noKl, or ®above “ 5 below = MOK   (5.73) Thus the component of B that is parallel to the surface but perpendicular to the current is discontinuous in the amount hqK. A similar amperian loop running parallel to the current reveals that the parallel component is continuous. These results can be summarized in a single formula: ®above ~ ®below = ffi)(K X n), (5.74) where n is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing “upward.” Figure 5.49 242 CHAPTER 5.

But the derivative of A inherits the discontinuity of B: 9Aabove ^ ^below 3 n 3 n = -MoK. (5.76i Problem 5.31 (a) Check Eq. 5.74 for the configuration in Ex. 5.9.

[Suggestion: I’d set up Cartesian coordinates at the surface, with z perpendicular to the surface and x parallel to the current.] 5.4.3 Multipole Expansion of the Vector Potential If you want an approximate formula for the vector potential of a localized current distri¬ bution, valid at distant points, a multipole expansion is in order. Remember: the idea of a multipole expansion is to write the potential in the form of a power series in 1/r, where r F the distance to the point in question (Fig. 5.51); if r is sufficiently large, the series will be 15N ote that Eqs. 5.75 and 5.76 presuppose that A is divergenceless. 5.4. MAGNETIC VECTOR POTENTIAL 243 Figure 5.51 dominated by the lowest nonvanishing contribution, and the higher terms can be ignored. As we found in Sect. 3.4.1 (Eq. 3.94), 1 _ 1 ^ v/r2 + (r')2 — 2rr’ cos 6' 1 r 00 E n=0 ^ P n (cos O'). Accordingly, the vector potential of a current loop can be written (5-77) A(r) = 4iT / J rfl' = 47 £ 'pin f (cose')rfl' n=0 or, more explicitly: - (j) dl' -{—^ r' c°s 0' dl' (5.78) A(r) = — 47T -^3 £(r') 2 COS2 9' - l ) dX 4- (5.79) As in the multipole expansion of V, we call the first term (which goes like I / r ) the monopole term, the second (which goes like 1/r2) dipole, the third quadrupole, and so on. Now, it happens that the magnetic monopole term is always zero, for the integral is just the total vector displacement around a closed loop: j) dX = 0. (5.80) This reflects the fact that there are (apparently) no magnetic monopoles in nature (an as¬ sumption contained in Maxwell’s equation V • B = 0, on which the entire theory of vector potential is predicated). 244 CHAPTER 5.

(5.84) Here a is the “vector area” of the loop (Prob. 1.61); if the loop is flat, a is the ordinary area enclosed, with the direction assigned by the usual right hand rule (fingers in the direction of the current). Example 5.13 Find the magnetic dipole moment of the “bookend-shaped” loop shown in Fig. 5.52. All sides have length w, and it carries a current I. Solution: This wire could be considered the superposition of two plane square loops (Fig. 5.531. The “extra” sides (A B) cancel when the two are put together, since the currents flow in opposite directions. The net magnetic dipole moment is 7 * 9 ys m = Iw y + Iw z; its magnitude is x/2/id 2 , and it points along the 45° line z = y. Figure 5.52 5.4. MAGNETIC VECTOR POTENTIAL 245 Figure 5.53 It is clear from Eq. 5.84 that the magnetic dipole moment is independent of the choice of origin. You may remember that the electric dipole moment is independent of the origin only when the total charge vanishes (Sect. 3.4.3). Since the magnetic monopole moment is always zero, it is not really surprising that the magnetic dipole moment is always independent of origin. Although the dipole term dominates the multipole expansion (unless m = 0), and thus offers a good approximation to the true potential, it is not ordinarily the exact potential; there will be quadrupole, octopole, and higher contributions. You might ask, is it possible to devise a current distribution whose potential is “pure” dipole—for which Eq. 5.83 is exact? Well, yes and no: like the electrical analog, it can be done, but the model is a bit contrived. To begin with, you must take an infinitesimally small loop at the origin, but then, in order to keep the dipole moment finite, you have to crank the current up to infinity, with the product m = la held fixed. In practice, the dipole potential is a suitable approximation whenever the distance r greatly exceeds the size of the loop. The magnetic field of a (pure) dipole is easiest to calculate if we put m at the origin and let it point in the ’-direction (Fig. 5.54). According to Eq. 5.83, the potential at point Figure 5.54 246 CHAPTER 5.

MAGNETIC VECTOR POTENTIAL 247 More Problems on Chapter 5 Problem 5.38 It may have pccurred to you that since parallel currents attract, the current within a single wire should contract into a tiny concentrated stream along the axis. Yet in practice the current typically distributes Itself quite uniformly over the wire. How do you account for this? If the positive charges (density p+) are at rest, and the negative charges (density p-) move at speed v (and none of these depends on the distance from the axis), show that p- = —p+y 2, where y = 1/Vl - (v/c)2 and c2 = \\/p.Q(Q. If the wire as a whole is neutral, where is the compensating charge located?16 [Notice that for typical velocities (see Prob. 5.19) the two charge densities are essentially unchanged by the current (since y as 1). In plasmas, however, where the positive charges are also free to move, this so-called pinch effect can be very significant.] Problem 5.39 A current I flows to the right through a rectangular bar of conducting material, in the presence of a uniform magnetic field B pointing out of the page (Fig. 5.56). (a) If the moving charges are positive, in which direction are they deflected by the magnetic field? This deflection results in an accumulation of charge on the upper and lower surfaces of the bar, which in turn produces an electric force to counteract the magnetic one. Equilibrium occurs when the two exactly cancel. (This phenomenon is known as the Hall effect.) (b) Find the resulting potential difference (the Hall voltage) between the top and bottom of the bar, in terms of B, v (the speed of the charges), and the relevant dimensions of the bar.17 (c) How would your analysis change if the moving charges were negative?

(If you seem to be getting an “extra” term, it will help to note that dI2 • i = dn..) Problem 5.50 (a) One way to fill in the “missing link” in Fig. 5.48 is to exploit the analogy between the defining equations for A (V • A = 0, V x A = B) and Maxwell’s equations for B (V • B = 0.

Yet all magnetic phenomena are due to electric charges in motion, and in fact, if you could examine a piece of magnetic material on an atomic scale you would find tiny currents: electrons orbiting around nuclei and electrons spinning about their axes. For macroscopic purposes, these current loops are so small that we may treat them as magnetic dipoles. Ordinarily, they cancel each other out because of the random orientation of the atoms. But when a magnetic field is applied, a net alignment of these magnetic dipoles occurs, and the medium becomes magnetically polarized, or magnetized. Unlike electric polarization, which is almost always in the same direction as E, some materials acquire a magnetization parallel to B (paramagnets) and some opposite to B (rfi'amagnets). A few substances (called/erromagnets, in deference to the most common example, iron) retain their magnetization even after the external field has been removed— for these the magnetization is not determined by the present field but by the whole magnetic “history” of the object. Permanent magnets made of iron are the most familiar examples of magnetism, though from a theoretical point of view they are the most complicated; I’ll save ferromagnetism for the end of the chapter, and begin with qualitative models of paramagnetism and diamagnetism. 6.1.2 Torques and Forces on Magnetic Dipoles A magnetic dipole experiences a torque in a magnetic field, just as an electric dipole does in an electric field. Let’s calculate the torque on a rectangular current loop in a uniform field B. (Since any current loop could be built up from infinitesimal rectangles, with all 255 256 CHAPTER 6. MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER the “internal” sides canceling, as indicated in Fig. 6.1, there is no actual loss of generality in using this shape; but if you prefer to start from scratch with an arbitrary shape, see Prob. 6.2.) Center the loop at the origin, and tilt it an angle 6 from the z axis towards the y axis (Fig. 6.2). Let B point in the z direction. The forces on the two sloping sides cancel (they tend to stretch the loop, but they don’t rotate it). The forces on the “horizontal” sides are likewise equal and opposite (so the net force on the loop is zero), but they do generate a torque: N = aFsin^x. The magnitude of the force on each of these segments is F = IbB, Figure 6.2 6.1. MAGNETIZATION 257 or N = m x B, (6.1) where m — lab is the magnetic dipole moment of the loop. Equation 6.1 gives the exact torque on any localized current distribution, in the presence of a uniform field; in a nonuniform field it is the exact torque (about the center) for a perfect dipole of infinitesimal size. Notice that Eq. 6.1 is identical in form to the electrical analog, Eq. 4.4: N = p x E. In particular, the torque is again in such a direction as to line the dipole up parallel to the field. It is this torque that accounts for paramagnetism. Since every electron constitutes a magnetic dipole (picture it, if you wish, as a tiny spinning sphere of charge), you might expect paramagnetism to be a universal phenomenon. Actually, the laws of quantum mechanics (specifically, the Pauli exclusion principle) dictate that the electrons within a given atom lock together in pairs with opposing spins, and this effectively neutralizes the torque on the combination. As a result, paramagnetism normally occurs in atoms or molecules with an odd number of electrons, where the “extra” unpaired member is subject to the magnetic torque. Even here the alignment is far from complete, since random thermal collisions tend to destroy the order. In a uniform field, the net force on a current loop is zero: F = x B) = / x B = 0; the constant B comes outside the integral, and the net displacement <f dl around a closed loop vanishes. In a nonuniform field this is no longer the case. For example, suppose a circular wire of radius R, carrying a current /, is suspended above a short solenoid in the “fringing” region (Fig. 6.3). Here B has a radial component, and there is a net downward force on the loop (Fig. 6.4): F = IjiIRB cos 6. (6.2) Figure 6.3 Figure 6.4 258 CHAPTER 6, MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER For an infinitesimal loop, with dipole moment m, in a field B, the force is F = V (m B) (6.3) (see Prob. 6.4). Once again the magnetic formula is identical to its electrical “twin,” provided we agree to write the latter in the form F = V(p • E). If you’re starting to get a sense of clejc'i vu, perhaps you will have more respect for those early physicists who thought magnetic dipoles consisted of positive and negative magnetic “charges” (north and south “poles,” they called them), separated by a small distance, just like electric dipoles (Fig. 6.5(a)). They wrote down a “Coulomb’s law” for the attraction and repulsion of these poles, and developed the whole of magnetostatics in exact analogy to electrostatics. It’s not a bad model, for many purposes—it gives the correct field of a dipole (at least, away from the origin), the right torque on a dipole (at least, on a stationan dipole), and the proper force on a dipole (at least, in the absence of external currents). But it’s bad physics, because there’s no such thing as a single magnetic north pole or south pole. If you break a bar magnet in half, you don’t get a north pole in one hand and a south pole in the other; you get two complete magnets. Magnetism is not due to magnetic monopoles, but rather to moving electric charges-, magnetic dipoles are tiny current loops (Fig. 6.5(c)). and it’s an extraordinary thing, really, that the formulas involving m bear any resemblance at all to the corresponding formulas for p. Sometimes it is easier to think in terms of the “Gilbert” model of a magnetic dipole (separated monopoles) instead of the physicallv correct “Ampere” model (current loop). Indeed, this picture occasionally offers a quick and clever solution to an otherwise cumbersome problem (you just copy the corresponding result from electrostatics, changing p to m, I /fo to /<o, and E to B). But whenever the close-up features of the dipole come into play, the two models can yield strikingly different answers. My advice is to use the Gilbert model, if you like, to get an intuitive “feel” for a problem, but never rely on it for quantitative results. N 1 » i A p m c.

As an example, calculate (m • V)B for the configurations in (a) and (b). 6.1.3 Effect of a Magnetic Field on Atomic Orbits Electrons not only spin; they also revolve around the nucleus—for simplicity, let’s assume the orbit is a circle of radius R (Fig. 6.9). Although technically this orbital motion does not constitute a steady current, in practice the period T = InR/v is so short that unless you blink awfully fast, it’s going to look like a steady current: e ev ~ T ~ TkR' Accordingly, the orbital dipole moment (InR 2) is 1 m = —evR z. 2 (6.4) (The minus sign accounts for the negative charge of the electron.) Like any other magnetic dipole, this one is subject to a torque (m x B) when the atom is placed in a magnetic field. But it’s a lot harder to tilt the entire orbit than it is the spin, so the orbital contribution to paramagnetism is small. There is, however, a more significant effect on the orbital motion: Figure 6.9 6.1. MAGNETIZATION 261 The electron speeds up or slows down, depending on the orientation of B. For whereas the centripetal acceleration v2/R is ordinarily sustained by electrical forces alone,1 1 e2 v2 -- — me — 4tt6 0 R2 R (6.5) in the presence of a magnetic field there is an additional force, — e(y x B). For the sake of argument, let’s say that B is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, as shown in Fig. 6.10; then 1 e2 47T6o R 2 + evB = me R (6.6) Under these conditions, the new speed v is greater than v: _ trip _nip __ _ evB = — (ir — it) = —(i> + u)(u — i>), R R or, assuming the change Av = v — v is small, Av = eRB 2 me (6.7) When B is turned on, then, the electron speeds up.2 A change in orbital speed means a change in the dipole moment (6.4): Am = --e(Av)Rz —B 4 me (6.8) Notice that the change in m is opposite to the direction of B. (An electron circling the other way would have a dipole moment pointing upward, but such an orbit would be slowed 'To avoid confusion with the magnetic dipole moment m, I’ll write the electron mass with subscript: me. 2I said earlier (Eq. 5.11) that magnetic fields do no work, and are incapable of speeding a particle up. I stand by that. However, as we shall see in Chapter 7, a changing magnetic field induces an electric field, and it is the latter that accelerates the electrons in this instance. 262 CHAPTER 6. MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER down by the field, so the change is still opposite to B.) Ordinarily, the electron orbits are randomly oriented, and the orbital dipole moments cancel out. But in the presence of a magnetic field, each atom picks up a little “extra” dipole moment, and these increments are all antiparallel to the field. This is the mechanism responsible for diamagnetism. It is a universal phenomenon, affecting all atoms. However, it is typically much weaker than paramagnetism, and is therefore observed mainly in atoms with even numbers of electrons, where paramagnetism is usually absent. In deriving Eq. 6.8 I assumed that the orbit remains circular, with its original radius R. 1 cannot offer a justification for this at the present stage. If the atom is stationary while the field is turned on, then my assumption can be proved—this is not magneto statics, however, and the details will have to await Chapter 7 (see Prob. 7.49). If the atom is moved into the field, the situation is enormously more complicated. But never mind—I’m only trying to give you a qualitative account of diamagnetism. Assume, if you prefer, that the velocity remains the same while the radius changes—the formula (6.8) is altered (by a factor of 2), but the conclusion is unaffected. The truth is that this classical model is fundamentally flawed (diamagnetism is really a quantum phenomenon), so there’s not much point in refining the details.3 What is important is the empirical fact that in diamagnetic materials the induced dipole moments point opposite to the magnetic field. 6.1.4 Magnetization In the presence of a magnetic field, matter becomes magnetized; that is, upon microscopic examination it will be found to contain many tiny dipoles, with a net alignment along some direction. We have discussed two mechanisms that account for this magnetic polarization: (1) paramagnetism (the dipoles associated with the spins of unpaired electrons experience a torque tending to line them up parallel to the field) and (2) diamagnetism (the orbital speed of the electrons is altered in such a way as to change the orbital dipole moment in a direction opposite to the field). Whatever the cause, we describe the state of magnetic polarization by the vector quantity M = magnetic dipole moment per unit volume, (6.9 > M is called the magnetization; it plays a role analogous to the polarization P in elec¬ trostatics. In the following section, we will not worry about how the magnetization got there—it could be paramagnetism, diamagnetism, or even ferromagnetism—we shall take M as given, and calculate the field this magnetization itself produces. Incidentally, it may have surprised you to learn that materials other than the famous ferromagnetic trio (iron, nickel, and cobalt) are affected by a magnetic field at all. You cannot, of course, pick up a piece of wood or aluminum with a magnet. The reason is that diamagnetism and paramagnetism are extremely weak: It takes a delicate experiment and a powerful magnet to detect them at all. If you were to suspend a piece of paramagnetic 3S. L.

Leighton, and M. Sands. The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 2, Sec. 34-36 (New York: Addison-Wesley, 1966). 6.2. THE FIELD OF A MAGNETIZED OBJECT 263 material above a solenoid, as in Fig. 6.3, the induced magnetization would be upward, and hence the force downward. By contfast, the magnetization of a diamagnetic object would be downward and the force upward. In general, when a sample is placed in a region of nonuni¬ form field, the parama'gnet is attracted into the field, whereas the diamagnet is repelled away. But the actual forces are pitifully weak—in a typical experimental arrangement the force on a comparable sample of iron would be 104 or 105 times as great. That’s why it was reasonable for us to calculate the field inside a piece of copper wire, say, in Chapter 5, without worrying about the effects of magnetization. Problem 6.6 Of the following materials, which would you expect to be paramagnetic and which diamagnetic? Aluminum, copper, copper chloride (CuCl2 ), carbon, lead, nitrogen (N2 ), salt (NaCl), sodium, sulfur, water. (Actually, copper is slightly diamagnetic; otherwise they’re all what you’d expect.) 6.2 The Field of a Magnetized Object 6.2.1 Bound Currents Suppose we have a piece of magnetized material; the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume, M, is given. What field does this object produce? Well, the vector potential of a single dipole m is given by Eq. 5.83: A(r) = (tomxt 47T 42 (6.10) In the magnetized object, each volume element dt' carries a dipole moment M dr', so the total vector potential is (Fig. 6.11) A(r) pp f M(r') x i ^ An J 4 2 (6.11) Figure 6.11 264 CHAPTER 6. MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER That does it, in principle. But as in the electrical case (Sect. 4.2.1), the integral can be cast in a more illuminating form by exploiting the identity V'i 4 4- * ~2‘ With this, M(r') x (V ,1 A<r) = s/ Integrating by parts, using product rule 7, gives [/VxM(rO]^-/V' A(r) = 47T dz'.

J b = V x M, (6.12) (6.13) while the second looks like the potential of a surface current, Kj, = Mxn, where n is the normal unit vector.

(6.15) 47T 7V 4 An Js 4 What this means is that the potential (and hence also the field) of a magnetized object is the same as would be produced by a volume current J* = V x M throughout the material, plus a surface current K/, = M x n, on the boundary. Instead of integrating the contributions of all the infinitesimal dipoles, as in Eq. 6.11, we first determine these bound currents, and then find the field they produce, in the same way we would calculate the field of any other volume and surface currents. Notice the striking parallel with the electrical case: there the field of a polarized object was the same as that of a bound volume charge pb = - V • P plus a bound surface charge <t/, = P • n. Example 6.1 Find the magnetic field of a uniformly magnetized sphere. Solution: Choosing the z axis along the direction of M (Fig. 6.12), we have 6.2. THE FIELD OF A MAGNF.TT7.ED OBJECT 265 \\1   0 ^ Figure 6.12 Now, a rotating spherical shell, of uniform surface charge a, corresponds to a surface current density K = crv = acoR sin 9 <(>. It follows, therefore, that the field of a uniformly magnetized sphere is identical to the field of a spinning spherical shell, with the identification cr Ra> ->   M. Referring back to Ex. 5.11, I conclude that B = -/z 0M, (6.16) inside the sphere, whereas the field outside is the same as that of a pure dipole, 4 , m = 3 Notice that the internal field is uniform, like the electric field inside a uniformly polarized sphere (Eq. 4.14), although the actual formulas for the two cases are curiously different (| in place of — j). The external fields are also analogous: pure dipole in both instances. Problem 6.7 An infinitely long circular cylinder carries a uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. Find the magnetic field (due to M) inside and outside the cylinder. Problem 6.8 A long circular cylinder of radius R carries a magnetization M = ks2 <j>, where k is a constant, .v is the distance from the axis, and (j> is the usual azimuthal unit vector (Fig. 6.13). Find the magnetic field due to M, for points inside and outside the cylinder. Problem 6.9 A short circular cylinder of radius a and length L carries a “frozen-in” uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. Find the bound current, and sketch the magnetic field of the cylinder. (Make three sketches: one for L » a, one for L « a. and one for L »= a.) Compare this bar magnet with the bar electret of Prob. 4.11. 266 CHAPTER 6. MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER Figure 6.13 Figure 6.14 Problem 6.10 An iron rod of length L and square cross section (side a), is given a uniform longitudinal magnetization M, and then bent around into a circle with a narrow gap (width w). as shown in Fig. 6.14. Find the magnetic field at the center of the gap, assuming w <SC a <SC L. [Hint: treat it as the superposition of a complete torus plus a square loop with reversed current.] 6.2.2 Physical Interpretation of Bound Currents In the last section we found that the field of a magnetized object is identical to the field that would be produced by a certain distribution of “bound” currents, Jh and K/,. I want to show you how these bound currents arise physically. This will be a heuristic argument—the rigorous derivation has already been given. Figure 6.15 depicts a thin slab of uniformly magnetized material, with the dipoles represented by tiny current loops. Notice that all the “internal” currents cancel: every time there is one going to the right, a contiguous one is going to the left. However, at the edge there is no adjacent loop to do the canceling. The whole thing, then, is equivalent to a single ribbon of current I flowing around the boundary (Fig. 6.16). 6.2. THE FIELD OF A MAGNETIZED OBJECT 267 Figure 6.15 Figure 6.16 What is this current, in terms of M? Say that each of the tiny loops has area a and thickness t (Fig. 6.17). In terms of the magnetization M, its dipole moment is m ~ Mat. In terms of the circulating current /, however, m = la. Therefore / = Mt, so the surface current is Kb = I/t = M. Using the outward-drawn unit vector n (Fig. 6.16), the direction of K h is conveniently indicated by the cross product: K* = M x n. (This expression also records the fact that there is no current on the top or bottom surface of the slab; here M is parallel to n, so the cross product vanishes.) ² M Figure 6.17 This bound surface current is exactly what we obtained in Sect. 6.2.1. It is a peculiar kind of current, in the sense that no single charge makes the whole trip—on the contrary, each charge moves only in a tiny little loop within a single atom. Nevertheless, the net effect is a macroscopic current flowing over the surface of the magnetized object. We call it a “bound” current to remind ourselves that every charge is attached to a particular atom, but it’s a perfectly genuine current, and it produces a magnetic field in the same way any other current does. When the magnetization is nonuniform, the internal currents no longer cancel. Figure 6.18a shows two adjacent chunks of magnetized material, with a larger arrow on the one to the right suggesting greater magnetization at that point. On the surface where they join there is a net current in the x-direction, given by lx = lM z( y +d\\) - M z(y)]dz = dydz   dy 268 CHAPTER 6. MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER Figure 6.18 The corresponding volume current density is therefore By the same token, a nonuniform magnetization in the y-direction would contribute an amount —dMy/dz (Fig. 6.18b), so dM 7 dMy Ub)x = ~~ ~~- ay az In general, then, J b = V x M, consistent, again, with the result of Sect. 6.2.1. Incidentally, like any other steady current. J h should obey the conservation law 5.31: V-J b= 0 . Does it? Yes, for the divergence of a curl is always zero. 6.2.3 The Magnetic Field Inside Matter Like the electric field, the actual microscopic magnetic field inside matter fluctuates wildly from point to point and instant to instant. When we speak of “the” magnetic field in matter, we mean the macroscopic field: the average over regions large enough to contain mam atoms. (The magnetization M is “smoothed out” in the same sense.) It is this macroscopic field one obtains when the methods of Sect. 6.2.1 are applied to points inside magnetized material, as you can prove for yourself in the following problem. Problem 6.11 In Sect, 6.2.1, we began with the potential of a perfect dipole (Eq. 6.10). whereas in fact we are dealing with physical dipoles. Show, by the method of Sect. 4.2.3, that we nonetheless get the correct macroscopic field. 6.3. THE AUXILIARY FIELD H 269 6.3 The Auxiliary Field H 6.3.1 Ampere’s law in Magnetized Materials In Sect. 6.2 we found that the effect of magnetization is to establish bound currents J b = V x M within the material and K/, = M x n on the surface. The field due to magnetization of the medium is just the field produced by these bound currents. We are now ready to put everything together: the field attributable to bound currents, plus the field due to everything else—which I shall call the free current. The free current might flow through wires imbedded in the magnetized substance or, if the latter is a conductor, through the material itself. In any event, the total current can be written as J = Jfc+J/. (6.17) There is no new physics in Eq. 6.17; it is simply a convenience to separate the current into these two parts because they got there by quite different means: the free current is there because somebody hooked up a wire to a battery—it involves actual transport of charge; the bound current is there because of magnetization—it results from the conspiracy of many aligned atomic dipoles. In view of Eqs. 6.13 and 6.17, Ampere’s law can be written — (V xB)=J = J/ + J /,=J / + (VxM), Mo or, collecting together the two curls: Vx(Tb-m)= J /. The quantity in parentheses is designated by the letter H: H = —B - M. Mo (6.18) In terms of H, then, Ampere’s law reads VxH^J;, (6.19) or, in integral form, 3 (H.dl = / /mc (6.20) where 7/enc is the total free current passing through the Amperian loop. H plays a role in magnetostatics analogous to D in electrostatics: Just as D allowed us to write Gauss’s law in terms of the free charge alone, H permits us to express Ampere’s law in terms of the free current alone—and free current is what we control directly. Bound current, like bound charge, comes along for the ride—the material gets magnetized, and 270 CHAPTER 6. MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER this results in bound currents; we cannot turn them on or off independently, as we can free currents. In applying Eq. 6.20 all we need to worry about is the free current, which we know about because we put it there. In particular, when symmetry permits, we can calculate H immediately from Eq. 6.20 by the usual Ampere’s law methods. (For example, Probs. 6.7 and 6.8 can be done in one line by noting that H = 0.) Example 6.2 A long copper rod of radius R carries a uniformly distributed (free) current / (Fig. 6.19). Find H inside and outside the rod. Solution: Copper is weakly diamagnetic, so the dipoles will line up opposite to the field. This results in a bound current running antiparallel to / within the wire and parallel to / along the surface (see Fig. 6.20). Just how great these bound currents will be we are not yet in a position Amperian loop Figure 6.19 Figure 6.20 6.3. THE AUXILIARY FIELD H 271 to say—but in order to calculate H it is sufficient to realize that all the currents are longitudinal, so B, M, and therefore also H, are circumferential. Applying Eq. 6.20 to an Amperian loop of radius s < R, so H{2ns) = It = I- - Anc nR2 ’ H = 2:tR 2 sij> (s < R). within the wire. Meanwhile, outside the wire (6.21) / 2ns (,y > R). (6.22) In the latter region (as always, in empty space) M = 0, so B = (i 0H tlpl 2ns U > R)< the same as for a nonmagnetized wire (Ex. 5.7). Inside the wire B cannot be determined at this stage, since we have no way of knowing M (though in practice the magnetization in copper is so slight that for most purposes we can ignore it altogether). As it turns out, H is a more useful quantity than D. In the laboratory you will frequently hear people talking about H (more often even than B), but you will never hear anyone speak of D (only E). The reason is this: To build an electromagnet you run a certain (free) current through a coil. The current is the thing you read on the dial, and this determines H (or at any rate, the line integral of H); B depends on the specific materials you used and even, if iron is present, on the history of your magnet. On the other hand, if you want to set up an electric field, you do not plaster a known free charge on the plates of a parallel plate capacitor; rather, you connect them to a battery of known voltage. It’s the potential difference you read on your dial, and that determines E (or at any rate, the line integral of E); D depends on the details of the dielectric you’re using. If it were easy to measure charge, and hard to measure potential, then you’d find experimentalists talking about D instead of E. So the relative familiarity of H, as contrasted with D, derives from purely practical considerations; theoretically, they’re all on equal footing. Many authors call H, not B, the “magnetic field.” Then they have to invent a new word for B: the “flux density,” or magnetic “induction” (an absurd choice, since that term already has at least two other meanings in electrodynamics). Anyway, B is indisputably the fundamental quantity, so I shall continue to call it the “magnetic field,” as everyone does in the spoken language. H has no sensible name: just call it “H”.4 4bor those who disagree, I quote A. Sommerfeld's Electrodynamics (New York: Academic Press, 1952), p. 45: “The unhappy term ‘magnetic field’ for H should be avoided as far as possible. It seems to us that this term has led into error none less than Maxwell himself...\" 272 CHAPTER 6. MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER Problem 6.12 An infinitely long cylinder, of radius R, carries a “frozen-in” magnetization, parallel to the axis, M = ks z, where k is a constant and s is the distance from the axis; there is no free current anywhere. Find the magnetic field inside and outside the cylinder by two different methods: (a) As in Sect. 6.2, locate all the bound currents, and calculate the field they produce. (b) Use Ampere’s law (in the form of Eq. 6.20) to find H, and then get B from Eq. 6.18. (Notice that the second method is much faster, and avoids any explicit reference to the bound currents, i Problem 6.13 Suppose the field inside a large piece of magnetic material is Bp, so that Hq = (1/mo)®o - M - (a) Now a small spherical cavity is hollowed out of the material (Fig. 6.21).

[Hint: Carving out a cavity is the same as superimposing an object of the same shape but opposite magnetization.] 6.3.2 A Deceptive Parallel Equation 6.19 looks just like Ampere’s original law (5.54), only the total current is replaced by the. free current, and B is replaced by //0H. As in the case of D, however, I must warn you against reading too much into this correspondence. It does not say that /^0H is “just like B, only its source is Jf instead of J.” For the curl alone does not determine a vector field—you must know the divergence as well. And whereas V • B = 0, the divergence of H is not, in general, zero. In fact, from Eq. 6.18 V H = -V M. (6.23) Only when the divergence of M vanishes is the parallel between B and /^qH faithful. If you think I’m being pedantic, consider the example of the bar magnet—a short cylinder of iron that carries a permanent uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. (See Probs. 6.9 and 6.14.) In this case there is no free current anywhere, and a naive application of Eq. 6.20 might lead you to suppose that H = 0, and hence that B = //-oM inside the magnet and B = 0 outside, which is nonsense. It is quite true that the curl of H vanishes everywhere, but the divergence does not. (Can you see where V • M = 0?) Advice: When you are asked to find B or H in a problem involving magnetic materials, first look for symmetry. If the problem exhibits cylindrical, plane, solenoidal, or toroidal symmetry, then you can get H directly from Eq. 6.20 by the usual Ampere’s law methods. (Evidently, in such cases V • M is automatically zero, since the free current alone determines the answer.) If the requisite symmetry is absent, you’ll have to think of another approach, and in particular you must not assume that H is zero just because you see no free current. 6.3.3 Boundary Conditions The magnetostatic boundary conditions of Sect. 5.4.2 can be rewritten in terms of H and the free current. From Eq. 6.23 it follows that ^above — ^below — — (-^above — ^below)’ (6-24) while Eq. 6.19 says H above ~ H below = K / x \"• (6.25) 274 CHAPTER 6. MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER In the presence of materials these are sometimes more useful than the corresponding bound¬ ary conditions on B (Eqs. 5.72 and 5.73): tfaLe - *talow = 0. (6-26) and B !bove- B below = M(Kxn). (6.27) You might want to check them, for Ex. 6.2 or Prob. 6.14. Problem 6.14 For the bar magnet of Prob. 6.9, make careful sketches of M, B, and H, assuming L is about 2a. Compare Prob. 4.17. Problem 6.15 If Jy =0 everywhere, the curl of H vanishes (Eq. 6.19), and we can express H as the gradient of a scalar potential W: H = -Vlf. According to Eq. 6.23, then, V2w = (V -M), so W obeys Poisson’s equation, with V • M as the “source.” This opens up all the machinen of Chapter 3. As an example, find the field inside a uniformly magnetized sphere (Ex. 6.1) b> separation of variables. [Hint: V • M = 0 everywhere except at the surface (r = R), so U' satisfies Laplace’s equation in the regions r < R and r > R; use Eq. 3.65, and from Eq. 6.24 figure out the appropriate boundary condition on IV.] 6.4 Linear and Nonlinear Media 6.4.1 Magnetic Susceptibility and Permeability In paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials, the magnetization is sustained by the field; when B is removed, M disappears. In fact, for most substances the magnetization is proportional to the field, provided the field is not too strong. For notational consistency with the electrical case (Eq. 4.30), I should express the proportionality thus: M = — xmB (incorrect!). (6.28) TO But custom dictates that it be written in terms of H, instead of B: M — XmH* (6.29i The constant of proportionality Xm is called the magnetic susceptibility; it is a dimen¬ sionless quantity that varies from one substance to another—positive for paramagnets and negative for diamagnets. Typical values are around 10-5 (see Table 6.1). 6.4.

In view of Eq. 6.18, B = /z0(H + M) = /x0( 1 + Xm) H, (6.30) for linear media. Thus B is also proportional to H:5 B = fi H, (6.31) where E — MoO T Xm)‘ (6.32) [i is called the permeability of the material.6 In a vacuum, where there is no matter to magnetize, the susceptibility Xm vanishes, and the permeability is /xq- That’s why fiQ is called the permeability of free space.

Solution: Since B is due in part to bound currents (which we don’t yet know), we cannot compute it directly. However, this is one of those symmetrical cases in which we can get H from the free current alone, using Ampere’s law in the form of Eq. 6.20: H = nl z 5Physically, therefore, Eq. 6.28 would say exactly the same as Eq. 6.29, only the constant Xm would have a different value. Equation 6.29 is a little more convenient, because experimentalists find it handier to work with H than B. 6If you factor out /xq, what’s left is called the relative permeability: /xr = 1 + Xm = li/uo- By the way, formulas for H in terms of B (Eq. 6.31, in the case of linear media) are called constitutive relations, just like those for D in terms of E. 276 CHAPTER 6. MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER Figure 6.22 (Fig. 6.22). According to Eq. 6.31, then, B = fM0 ( 1 + Xm)nl z. If the medium is paramagnetic, the field is slightly enhanced; if it’s diamagnetic, the field i-. somewhat reduced. This reflects the fact that the bound surface current Kb = M x n = Xm(H x n) = / mn/4 > is in the same direction as/, in the former case (/ m > 0), and opposite in the latter (/ m < Oi. You might suppose that linear media avoid the defect in the parallel between B and H: since M and H are now proportional to B, does it not follow that their divergence, like B's. must always vanish? Unfortunately, it does not; at the boundary between two materials of different permeability the divergence of M can actually be infinite. For instance, at the end of a cylinder of linear paramagnetic material, M is zero on one side but not on the other. For the “Gaussian pillbox” shown in Fig. 6.23, <f M • da ^ 0, and hence, by the divergence theorem, V • M cannot vanish everywhere within. Gaussian pillbox Figure 6.23 6.4. LINEAR AND NONLINEAR MEDIA 277 Incidentally, the volume bound current density in a homogeneous linear material is proportional to the free current density: Ji = VxM = Vx (XmH ) = XmJf- (6.33) In particular, unless free current actually flows through the material, all bound current will be at the surface. Problem 6.16 A coaxial cable consists of two very long cylindrical tubes, separated by linear insulating material of magnetic susceptibility / m. A current I flows down the inner conductor and returns along the outer one; in each case the current distributes itself uniformly over the surface (Fig. 6.24). Find the magnetic field in the region between the tubes. As a check, calculate the magnetization and the bound currents, and confirm that (together, of course, with the free currents) they generate the correct field. Figure 6.24 Problem 6.17 A current / flows down a long straight wire of radius a. If the wire is made of linear material (copper, say, or aluminum) with susceptibility / m, and the current is distributed uniformly, what is the magnetic field a distance s from the axis? Find all the bound currents. What is the net bound current flowing down the wire? Problem 6.18 A sphere of linear magnetic material is placed in an otherwise uniform magnetic field B0. Find the new field inside the sphere. [Hint: See Prob. 6.15 or Prob. 4.23.] Problem 6.19 On the basis of the naive model presented in Sect. 6.1.3, estimate the magnetic susceptibility of a diamagnetic metal such as copper. Compare your answer with the empirical value in Table 6.1, and comment on any discrepancy. 278 CHAPTER 6. MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER 6.4.2 Ferromagnetism In a linear medium the alignment of atomic dipoles is maintained by a magnetic field im¬ posed from the outside. Ferromagnets—which are emphatically not linear7—require no external fields to sustain the magnetization; the alignment is “frozen in.” Like paramag¬ netism, ferromagnetism involves the magnetic dipoles associated with the spins of unpaired electrons. The new feature, which makes ferromagnetism so different from paramagnetism, is the interaction between nearby dipoles: In a ferromagnet, each dipole “likes” to point in the same direction as its neighbors. The reason for this preference is essentially quantum mechanical, and I shall not endeavor to explain it here; it is enough to know that the cor¬ relation is so strong as to align virtually 100% of the unpaired electron spins. If you could somehow magnify a piece of iron and “see” the individual dipoles as tiny arrows, it would look something like Fig. 6.25, with all the spins pointing the same way. Figure 6.25 But if that is true, why isn’t every wrench and nail a powerful magnet? The answer is that the alignment occurs in relatively small patches, called domains. Each domain contains billions of dipoles, all lined up (these domains are actually visible under a microscope, using suitable etching techniques—see Fig. 6.26), but the domains themselves are randomh oriented. The household wrench contains an enormous number of domains, and their magnetic fields cancel, so the wrench as a whole is not magnetized. (Actually, the orientation of domains is not completely random; within a given crystal there may be some preferential alignment along the crystal axes. But there will be just as many domains pointing one wa\\ as the other, so there is still no large-scale magnetization. Moreover, the crystals themselves are randomly oriented within any sizable chunk of metal.) How, then, would you produce a permanent magnet, such as they sell in toy stores? If you put a piece of iron into a strong magnetic field, the torque N = mxB tends to align the dipoles parallel to the field. Since they like to stay parallel to their neighbors, most of the dipoles will resist this torque. However, at the boundary between two domains, there 7 In this sense it is misleading to speak of the susceptibility or permeability of a ferromagnet. The terms are used for such materials, but they refer to the proportionality factor between a differential increase in H and the resulting differential change in M (or B); moreover, they are not constants, but functions of H. 6.4. LINEAR AND NONLINEAR MEDIA 219 Ferromagnetic domains. (Photo courtesy of R. W. DeBlois) Figure 6.26 are competing neighbors, and the torque will throw its weight on the side of the domain most nearly parallel to the field; this domain will win over some converts, at the expense of the less favorably oriented one. The net effect of the magnetic field, then, is to move the domain boundaries. Domains parallel to the field grow, and the others shrink. If the field is strong enough, one domain takes over entirely, and the iron is said to be “saturated.” It turns out that this process (the shifting of domain boundaries in response to an external field) is not entirely reversible; When the field is switched off, there will be some return to randomly oriented domains, but it is far from complete—there remains a preponderance of domains in the original direction. The object is now a permanent magnet. A simple way to accomplish this, in practice, is to wrap a coil of wire around the object to be magnetized (Fig. 6.27). Run a current / through the coil; this provides the external magnetic field (pointing to the left in the diagram). As you increase the current, the field increases, the domain boundaries move, and the magnetization grows. Eventually, you reach the saturation point, with all the dipoles aligned, and a further increase in current has no effect on M (Fig. 6.28, point b). Now suppose you reduce the current. Instead of retracing the path back to M = 0, there is only a partial return to randomly oriented domains. M decreases, but even with the current off there is some residual magnetization (point c). The wrench is now a permanent 280 CHAPTER 6. MAGNETIC FIELDS IN MATTER Figure 6.27 magnet. If you want to eliminate the remaining magnetization, you’ll have to run a current backwards through the coil (a negative I). Now the external field points to the right, and as you increase I (negatively), M drops down to zero (point d). If you turn I still higher, you soon reach saturation in the other direction—all the dipoles now pointing to the right (e). At this stage switching off the current will leave the wrench with a permanent magnetization to the right (point /). To complete the story, turn / on again in the positive sense: M returns to zero (point g), and eventually to the forward saturation point (b). The path we have traced out is called a hysteresis loop. Notice that the magnetization of the wrench depends not only on the applied field (that is, on /), but also on its previous magnetic “history.”8 For instance, at three different times in our experiment the current was zero (a, c, and /), yet the magnetization was different for each of them. Actually, it is customary to draw hysteresis loops as plots of B against H , rather than M against /. (If our coil is approximated by a long solenoid, with n turns per unit length, then H = nl, so H and / are proportional. Meanwhile, B = fio(H + M), but in practice M is huge compared to H, so to all intents and purposes B is proportional to M.) 8Etymologically, the word hysteresis has nothing to do with the word history— nor with the word hysteria. It derives from a Greek verb meaning “to lag behind.” 6.4. LINEAR AND NONLINEAR MEDIA 281 To make the units consistent (teslas), I have plotted (iiqH ) horizontally (Fig. 6.29); notice, however, that the vertical scale is 104 times greater than the horizontal one. Roughly speaking, /ioH is the field our coil would have produced in the absence of any iron; B is what we actually got, and compared to /xqH it is gigantic. A little current goes a long way when you have ferromagnetic materials around. That’s why anyone who wants to make a powerful electromagrjet will wrap the coil around an iron core. It doesn’t take much of an external field to move the domain boundaries, and as soon as you’ve done that, you have all the dipoles in the iron working with you. One final point concerning ferromagnetism: It all follows, remember, from the fact that the dipoles within a given domain line up parallel to one another. Random thermal motions compete with this ordering, but as long as the temperature doesn’t get too high, they cannot budge the dipoles out of line. It’s not surprising, though, that very high temperatures do destroy the alignment. What is surprising is that this occurs at a precise temperature (770° C, for iron). Below this temperature (called the Curie point), iron is ferromagnetic; above, it is paramagnetic. The Curie point is rather like the boiling point or the freezing point in that there is no gradual transition from ferro- to para-magnetic behavior, any more than there is between water and ice. These abrupt changes in the properties of a substance, occurring at sharply defined temperatures, are known in statistical mechanics as phase transitions. Problem 6.20 How would you go about demagnetizing a permanent magnet (such as the wrench we have been discussing, at point c in the hysteresis loop)? That is, how could you restore it to its original state, with M = 0 at / = 0? Problem 6.21 (a) Show that the energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field B is given by U = -m B.

(c) Express your answer to (b) in terms of the angles 0\\ and &2 in Fig. 6.30, and use the result to find the stable configuration two dipoles would adopt if held a fixed distance apart, but left free to rotate. (d) Suppose you had a large collection of compass needles, mounted on pins at regular intervals along a straight line. How would they point (assuming the earth’s magnetic field can be neglected)? [A rectangular array of compass needles also aligns itself spontaneously, and this is sometimes used as a demonstration of “ferromagnetic” behavior on a large scale. It’s a bit of a fraud, however, since the mechanism here is purely classical, and much weaker than the quantum mechanical exchange forces that are actually responsible for ferromagnetism.] More Problems on Chapter 6 Problem 6.22 In Prob. 6.4 you calculated the force on a dipole by “brute force.” Here’s a more elegant approach. First write B(r) as a Taylor expansion about the center of the loop: B(r)=B(r0) + [(r-ro)-V 0]B(ro), where ro is the position of the dipole and Vq denotes differentiation with respect to tq. Put this into the Lorentz force law (Eq. 5.16) to obtain F = / dl x [(r   V0)B(r0)]. Or, numbering the Cartesian coordinates from 1 to 3: 3 T, = I ^ e,jk { 6 n dlj J ['V0; Bk (r0)]. M./=l [J 1 6.4.

Use this observation, together with your knowledge of the electrostatic results, to rederive (a) the magnetic field inside a uniformly magnetized sphere (Eq. 6.16); (b) the magnetic field inside a sphere of linear magnetic material in an otherwise uniform magnetic field (Prob. 6.18); (c) the average magnetic field over a sphere, due to steady currents within the sphere (Eq. 5.89). Problem 6.24 Compare Eqs. 2.15, 4.9, and 6.11. Notice that if p, P, and M are uniform, the same integral is involved in all three: Therefore, if you happen to know the electric field of a uniformly charged object, you can immediately write down the scalar potential of a uniformly polarized object, and the vector potential of a uniformly magnetized object, of the same shape. Use this observation to obtain V inside and outside a uniformly polarized sphere (Ex. 4.2), and A inside and outside a uniformly magnetized sphere (Ex. 6.1). Problem 6.25 A familiar toy consists of donut-shaped permanent magnets (magnetization parallel to the axis), which slide frictionlessly on a vertical rod (Fig. 6.31). Treat the magnets as dipoles, with mass mj and dipole moment m.

Problem 6.28 You are asked to referee a grant application, which proposes to determine whether the magnetization of iron is due to “Ampere” dipoles (current loops) or “Gilbert” dipoles (separated magnetic monopoles). The experiment will involve a cylinder of iron (radius R and length L = 10??), uniformly magnetized along the direction of the axis. If the dipoles are Ampere-type, the magnetization is equivalent to a surface bound current K/, = M if they are Gilbert-type, the magnetization is equivalent to surface monopole densities &i, — ±M at the two ends. Unfortunately, these two configurations produce identical magnetic fields, at exterior points. However, the interior fields are radically different—in the first case B is in the same general direction as M, whereas in the second it is roughly opposite to M. The applicant proposes to measure this internal field by carving out a small cavity and finding the torque on a tiny compass needle placed inside. Assuming that the obvious technical difficulties can be overcome, and that the question itself is worthy of study, would you advise funding this experiment? If so, what shape cavity would you recommend? If not, what is wrong with the proposal? [Hint: refer to Probs. 4.11, 4.16, 6.9, and 6.13.] Chapter 7 Electrodynamics '.1 Electromotive Force 7.1.1 Ohm’s Law To make a current flow, you have to push on the charges. How fast they move, in response to a given push, depends on the nature of the material. For most substances, the current density J is proportional to the force per unit charge, f: J — rrf. (7.1) The proportionality factor a (not to be confused with surface charge) is an empirical con¬ stant that varies from one material to another; it’s called the conductivity of the medium. Actually, the handbooks usually list the reciprocal of a, called the resistivity: p = \\/a (not to be confused with charge density—I’m sorry, but we’re running out of Greek let¬ ters, and this is the standard notation). Some typical values are listed in Table 7.1. Notice that even insulators conduct slightly, though the conductivity of a metal is astronomically greater—by a factor of 1022 or so. In fact, for most purposes metals can be regarded as perfect conductors, with a = oo. In principle, the force that drives the charges to produce the current could be anything— chemical, gravitational, or trained ants with tiny harnesses. For our purposes, though, it’s usually an electromagnetic force that does the job. In this case Eq. 7.1 becomes J = er(E + v x B). (7.2) Ordinarily, the velocity of the charges is sufficiently small that the second term can be ignored: J = crE. (7.3) (However, in plasmas, for instance, the magnetic contribution to f can be significant.) Equation 7.3 is called Ohm’s law, though the physics behind it is really contained in Eq. 7.1, of which 7.3 is just a special case. 285 286 CHAPTER 7.

Source: Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 7 8th ed. (Boca Raton: CRC Press, Inc., 1997). I know: you’re confused because I said E = 0 inside a conductor (Sect. 2.5.1). But that’s for stationary charges (J = 0). Moreover, for perfect conductors E — J/er = 0 even if current is flowing. In practice, metals are such good conductors that the electric field required to drive current in them is negligible. Thus we routinely treat the connecting wires in electric circuits (for example) as equipotentials. Resistors, by contrast, are made from poorly conducting materials. Example 7.1 A cylindrical resistor of cross-sectional area A and length L is made from material with conductivity a. (See Fig. 7.1; as indicated, the cross section need not be circular, but I do assume it is the same all the way down.) If the potential is constant over each end, and the potential difference between the ends is V, what current flows? Figure 7.1 Solution: As it turns out, the electric field is uniform within the wire (I’ll prove this in a moment). It follows from Eq. 7.3 that the current density is also uniform, so a A I = J A = oEA = - V . L 7.1. ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE 287 Example 7.2 Two long cylinders (radii a and b) are separated by material of conductivity a (Fig. 7.2). If they are maintained at a potential difference V, what current flows from one to the other, in a length LI L Figure 7.2 Solution: The field between the cylinders is E = 2jreo s where A. is the charge per unit length on the inner cylinder. The current is therefore I = E • da = —XL. e0 (The integral is over any surface enclosing the inner cylinder.) Meanwhile, the potential difference between the cylinders is so V = - j E • d\\ —> 4- ) 2jreo \\a) 2no L In (jb/a) As these examples illustrate, the total current flowing from one electrode to the other is proportional to the potential difference between them: V = IR. (7.4) This, of course, is the more familiar version of Ohm’s law. The constant of proportionality R is called the resistance; it’s a function of the geometry of the arrangement and the conductivity of the medium between the electrodes. (In Ex. 7.1, R — (L/aA ); in Ex. 7.2, R = In (b/a)/2jtcrL.) Resistance is measured in ohms (Q): an ohm is a volt per ampere. Notice that the proportionality between V and I is a direct consequence of Eq. 7.3: if you want to double V, you simply double the charge everywhere—but that doubles E, which doubles J, which doubles I. 288 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS For steady currents and uniform conductivity, V • E = —V • J = 0, (7.5) a (Eq. 5.31), and therefore the charge density is zero; any unbalanced charge resides on the surface. (We proved this long ago, for the case of stationary charges, using the fact that E = 0; evidently, it is still true when the charges are allowed to move.) It follows, in particular, that Laplace’s equation holds within a homogeneous ohmic material carrying a steady current, so all the tools and tricks of Chapter 3 are available for computing the potential. Example 7.3 I asserted that the field in Ex. 7.1 is uniform. Let’s prove it. Solution: Within the cylinder V obeys Laplace’s equation. What are the boundary conditions? At the left end the potential is constant—we may as well set it equal to zero. At the right end the potential is likewise constant—call it Vo- On the cylindrical surface, J • n = 0, or else charge would be leaking out into the surrounding space (which we take to be nonconducting). Therefore E • n = 0, and hence 3 V/3 n = 0. With V or its normal derivative specified on all surfaces, the potential is uniquely determined (Prob. 3.4). But it’s easy to guess one potential that obeys Laplace’s equation and fits these boundary conditions: V(z) = Vqz L ’ where z is measured along the axis. The uniqueness theorem guarantees that this is the solution. The corresponding field is E = —W = — —z, L which is indeed uniform. qed Figure 7.3 Contrast the enormously more difficult problem that arises if the conducting material is removed, leaving only a metal plate at either end (Fig. 7.3). Evidently in the present case charge arranges itself over the surface of the wire in just such a way as to produce a nice uniform field within.1 1 Calculating this surface charge is not easy. See, for example, J. D. Jackson, Am. J. Phys. 64, 855 (1996). Nor is it a simple matter to determine the field outside the wire—see Prob. 7.57. 7.1. ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE 289 I don’t suppose there is any formula in physics more widely known than Ohm’s law, and yet it’s not really a true law, in the sense of Gauss’s law or Ampere’s law; rather, it is a “rule of thumb” that applies pretty well to many substances. You’re not going to win a Nobel prize for finding an exception. In fact, when you stop to think about it, it’s a little surprising that Ohm’s law ever holds. After all, a given field E produces a force qE (on a charge q), and according to Newton’s second law the charge will accelerate. But if the charges are accelerating, why doesn’t the current increase with time, growing larger and larger the longer you leave the field on? Ohm’s law implies, on the contrary, that a constant field produces a constant current, which suggests a constant velocity. Isn’t that a contradiction of Newton’s law? No, for we are forgetting the frequent collisions electrons make as they pass down the wire. It’s a little like this: Suppose you’re driving down a street with a stop sign at every intersection, so that, although you accelerate constantly in between, you are obliged to start all over again with each new block. Your average speed is then a constant, in spite of the fact that (save for the periodic abrupt stops) you are always accelerating. If the length of a block is A and your acceleration is a, the time it takes to go a block is t and hence the average velocity is 1 Pave — 2a * H  11 wait! That’s no good either! It says that the velocity is proportional to the square root of the acceleration, and therefore that the current should be proportional to the square root of the field! There’s another twist to the story: The charges in practice are already moving quite fast because of their thermal energy. But the thermal velocities have random directions, and average to zero. The net drift velocity we’re concerned with is a tiny extra bit (Prob. 5.19). So the time between collisions is actually much shorter than we supposed; in fact, A t = -, ^thermal and therefore 1 ak Pave = = X • d- ^thermal If there are n molecules per unit volume and / free electrons per molecule, each with charge q and mass m, the current density is J — n/^Vave nfqk F 2l lthermal tn _nfW_\\ E 2 111 ^thermal / (7.6) I don’t claim that the term in parentheses is an accurate formula for the conductivity,2 but it 2This classical model (due to Drude) bears little resemblance to the modem quantum theory of conductivity. See, for instance, D. Park’s Introduction to the Quantum Theory, 3rd ed., Chap. 15 (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1992). 290 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS does indicate the basic ingredients, and it correctly predicts that conductivity is proportional to the density of the moving charges and (ordinarily) decreases with increasing temperature. As a result of all the collisions; the work done by the electrical force is converted into heat in the resistor. Since the work done per unit charge is V and the charge flowing per unit time is I, the power delivered is P = VI = i2r . (7.7) This is the Joule heating law. With I in amperes and R in ohms, P comes out in watts (joules per second). Problem 7.1 Two concentric metal spherical shells, of radius a and b, respectively, are separated by weakly conducting material of conductivity a (Fig. 7.4a). (a) If they are maintained at a potential difference V, what current flows from one to the other? (b) What is the resistance between the shells? (c) Notice that if b » a the outer radius (fc) is irrelevant. How do you account for that? Exploit this observation to determine the current flowing between two metal spheres, each of radiuv a, immersed deep in the sea and held quite far apart (Fig. 7.4b), if the potential difference between them is V. (This arrangement can be used to measure the conductivity of sea water, i Figure 7.4 Problem 7.2 A capacitor C has been charged up to potential Vo; at time r = 0 it is connected to a resistor R, and begins to discharge (Fig. 7.5a).

Find the resistance between the cylinders. [Hint: Because a is a function of position, Eq. 7.5 does not hold, the charge density is not zero in the resistive medium, and E does not go like 1 /s. But we do know that for steady currents I is the same across each cylindrical surface. Take it from there.] 292 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS 7.1.2 Electromotive Force If you think about a typical electric circuit (Fig. 7.7)—a battery hooked up to a light bulb, say—there arises a perplexing question: In practice, the current is the same all the way around the loop, at any given moment; why is this the case, when the only obvious driving force is inside the battery? Off hand, you might expect this to produce a large current in the battery and none at all in the lamp. Who’s doing the pushing in the rest of the circuit, and how does it happen that this push is exactly right to produce the same current in each segment? What’s more, given that the charges in a typical wire move (literally) at a snail’s pace (see Prob. 5.19), why doesn’t it take half an hour for the news to reach the light bulb? How do all the charges know to start moving at the same instant? Figure 7.8 Answer: If the current is not the same all the way around (for instance, during the first split second after the switch is closed), then charge is piling up somewhere, and—here’s the crucial point—the electric field of this accumulating charge is in such a direction as to even out the flow. Suppose, for instance, that the current into the bend in Fig. 7.8 is greater than the current out. Then charge piles up at the “knee,” and this produces a field aiming away from the kink. This field opposes the current flowing in (slowing it down) and promotes the current flowing out (speeding it up) until these currents are equal, at which point there is no further accumulation of charge, and equilibrium is established. It’s a beautiful system, automatically self-correcting to keep the current uniform, and it does it all so quickly that, in practice, you can safely assume the current is the same all around the circuit even in systems that oscillate at radio frequencies. The upshot of all this is that there are really two forces involved in driving current around a circuit: the source, f v, which is ordinarily confined to one portion of the loop (a battery, say), and the electrostatic force, which serves to smooth out the flow and communicate the influence of the source to distant parts of the circuit: f = f5 + E. (7.8) The physical agency responsible for fs can be any one of many different things: in a battery it’s a chemical force; in a piezoelectric crystal mechanical pressure is converted into an 7.1. ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE 293 electrical impulse; in a thermocouple it’s a temperature gradient that does the job; in a photoelectric cell it’s light; and in a Van de Graaff generator the electrons are literally loaded onto a conveyer belt and swept along. Whatever the mechanism, its net effect is determined by the line integral of f around the circuit; (7.9) (Because (f E • dl = 0 for electrostatic fields, it doesn’t matter whether you use f or f s.) £ is called the electromotive force, or emf, of the circuit. It’s a lousy term, since this is not a force at all—it’s the integral of & force per unit charge. Some people prefer the word electromotance, but emf is so ingrained that I think we’d better stick with it. Within an ideal source of emf (a resistanceless battery,3 for instance), the net force on the charges is zero (Eq. 7.1 with a = oo), so E = — fs. The potential difference between the terminals (a and h) is therefore b pb Edl= fsd l = Ja (we can extend the integral to the entire loop because fs = 0 outside the source). The function of a battery, then, is to establish and maintain a voltage difference equal to the electromotive force (a 6 V battery, for example, holds the positive terminal 6 V above the negative terminal). The resulting electrostatic field drives current around the rest of the circuit (notice, however, that inside the battery f s drives current in the direction opposite to E). Because it’s the line integral of f,, £ can be interpreted as the work done, per unit charge, by the source—indeed, in some books electromotive force is defined this way. However, as you’ll see in the next section, there is some subtlety involved in this interpretation, so I prefer Eq. 7.9. f, • dl = £ (7.10) Problem 7.5 A battery of emf £ and internal resistance r is hooked up to a variable “load” resistance, R. If you want to deliver the maximum possible power to the load, what resistance R should you choose? (You can’t change £ and r, of course.) Problem 7.6 A rectangular loop of wire is situated so that one end (height h) is between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 7.9), oriented parallel to the field E. The other end is way outside, where the field is essentially zero. What is the emf in this loop? If the total resistance is R, what current flows? Explain. [Warning: this is a trick question, so be careful; if you have invented a perpetual motion machine, there’s probably something wrong with it.] 3Real batteries have a certain internal resistance, r. and the potential difference between their terminals is £ - Ir, when a current / is flowing. For an illuminating discussion of how batteries work, see D. Roberts, Am. J. Phys. 51, 829 (1983). 294 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS Figure 7.9 7.1.3 Motional emf In the last section I listed several possible sources of electromotive force in a circuit, batteries being the most familiar. But I did not mention the most common one of all: the generator. Generators exploit motional emf’s, which arise when you move a wire through a magnetic field. Figure 7.10 shows a primitive model for a generator. In the shaded region there is a uniform magnetic field B, pointing into the page, and the resistor R represents whatever it is (maybe a light bulb or a toaster) we’re trying to drive current through. If the entire loop is pulled to the right with speed v, the charges in segment ab experience a magnetic force whose vertical component qvB drives current around the loop, in the clockwise direction. The emf is dl = vBh (7.111 where h is the width of the loop. (The horizontal segments be and ad contribute nothing, since the force here is perpendicular to the wire.) Notice that the integral you perform to calculate £ (Eq. 7.9 or 7.11) is carried out at one instant of time—take a “snapshot” of the loop, if you like, and work from that. Thus dl. for the segment ab in Fig. 7.10, points straight up, even though the loop is moving to the right. You can’t quarrel with this—it’s simply the way emf is defined—but it is important to be clear about it. Figure 7.10 7. /. ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE 295 v Figure 7.11 In particular, although the magnetic force is responsible for establishing the emf, it is certainly not doing any work—magnetic forces never do work. Who, then, is supplying the energy that heats the resistor? Answer: The person who’s pulling on the loop! With the current flowing, charges in segment ab have a vertical velocity (call it u) in addition to the horizontal velocity v they inherit from the motion of the loop. Accordingly, the magnetic force has a component quB to the left. To counteract this, the person pulling on the wire must exert a force per unit charge /puli = uB to the right (Fig. 7.11). This force is transmitted to the charge by the structure of the wire. Meanwhile, the particle is actually moving in the direction of the resultant velocity w, and the distance it goes is (h/ cos 9). The work done per unit charge is therefore fpull • d\\ = (uB ) (-) sin9 = vBh = £ (sin 9 coming from the dot product). As it turns out, then, the work done per unit charge is exactly equal to the emf, though the integrals are taken along entirely different paths (Fig. 7.12) and completely different forces are involved. To calculate the emf you integrate around the loop at one instant, but to calculate the work done you follow a charge in its motion around the loop; fpun contributes nothing to the emf, because it is perpendicular to the wire, whereas f mag contributes nothing to work because it is perpendicular to the motion of the charge.4 There is a particularly nice way of expressing the emf generated in a moving loop. Let be the flux of B through the loop: I B • da. (7.12) For the rectangular loop in Fig. 7.10, = Bhx. 4 For further discussion, see E. P. Mosca, Am. J. Phys. 42, 295 (1974). 296 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS b c b c (a) Integration for computing (b) Integration path for calculating work £ (follow the wire at one instant done (follow the charge around the loop), of time). Figure 7.12 As the loop moves, the flux decreases: d<t> dx -= Bh — ih dt — Bhv. (The minus sign accounts for the fact that dx/dt is negative.) But this is precisely the emf (Eq. 7.11); evidently the emf generated in the loop is minus the rate of change of flux through the loop: (7.13) This is the flux rule for motional emf. Apart from its delightful simplicity, it has the virtue of applying to nonrectangular loops moving in arbitrary directions through nonuniform magnetic fields; in fact, the loop need not even maintain a fixed shape. Proof: Figure 7.13 shows a loop of wire at time t and also a short time dt later. Suppose we compute the flux at time t, using surface S, and the flux at time t + dt, using the surface consisting of S plus the “ribbon” that connects the new position of the loop to the old. The change in flux, then, is d<T> = <T>(t + dt) - <fi(f) = $ ribbon = / B   da. J ribbon Focus your attention on point P: in time dt it moves to P'. Let v be the velocity of the wire, and u the velocity of a charge down the wire; w = v + u is the resultant velocity of a charge at P. The infinitesimal element of area on the ribbon can be written as da = (v x d\\) dt 7.1. ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE Surface S Ribbon Enlargement of c/a time t time (t + dt) Figure 7.13 (see inset in Fig. 7.13). Therefore c/<D / S7=f \"-(vx-fl)- Since w = (v + u) and u is parallel to dl, we can also write this as d<S> dt -i B • (w x d\\). Now, the scalar triple-product can be rewritten: B • (w x d\\) = -(w x B) • dl, so d<S> f But (w x B) is the magnetic force per unit charge, f mag, so dt 7 and the integral of f mag is the emf fmag - d\\. £ = -^-. qed at 291 298 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS There is a sign ambiguity in the definition of emf (Eq. 7.9): Which way around the loop are you supposed to integrate? There is a compensatory ambiguity in the definition of flux (Eq. 7.12): Which is the positive direction for da? In applying the flux rule, sign consistency is governed (as always) by your right hand: If your fingers define the positive direction around the loop, then your thumb indicates the direction of da. Should the emf come out negative, it means the current will flow in the negative direction around the circuit. The flux rule is a nifty short-cut for calculating motional emf’s. It does not contain any new physics. Occasionally you will run across problems that cannot be handled by the flux rule; for these one must go back to the Lorentz force law itself. Example 7.4 A metal disk of radius a rotates with angular velocity w about a vertical axis, through a uniform field B, pointing up. A circuit is made by connecting one end of a resistor to the axle and the other end to a sliding contact, which touches the outer edge of the disk (Fig. 7.14). Find the current in the resistor. Figure 7.14 Solution: The speed of a point on the disk at a distance s from the axis is v = cos, so the force per unit charge is fmag = v x B = cos Bs. The emf is therefore £ = ds = coB l s ds = coBa^ 2 and the current is £ coBa^ ~R ~ 2 R The trouble with the flux rule is that it assumes the current flows along a well-defined path, whereas in this example the current spreads out over the whole disk. It’s not even clear what the “flux through the circuit” would mean in this context. Even more tricky is the case of eddy currents. Take a chunk of aluminum (say), and shake it around in a nonuniform magnetic field. Currents will be generated in the material, and you will feel a kind of “viscous drag”—as though you were pulling the block through molasses (this is the force I called f pun in the discussion of motional emf). Eddy currents are notoriously difficult to calculate,5 but easy and dramatic to demonstrate. You may have witnessed the classic experiment in which an 5 See, for example, W. M. Saslow, Am. J. Phys., <j0, 693 (1992). 7.1. ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE 299 aluminum disk mounted as a pendulum on a horizontal axis swings down and passes between the poles of a magnet (Fig. 7.15a). When it enters the field region it suddenly slows way down. To confirm that eddy currents are responsible, one repeats the process using a disk that has many slots cut in it, to prevent the flow of large-scale currents (Fig. 7.15b). This time the disk swings freely, unimpeded by the field. Problem 7.7 A metal bar of mass m slides frictionlessly on two parallel conducting rails a distance / apart (Fig. 7.16). A resistor R is connected across the rails and a uniform magnetic field B, pointing into the page, fills the entire region. Figure 7.16 300 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS (a) If the bar moves to the right at speed v, what is the current in the resistor? In what direction does it flow? (b) What is the magnetic force on the bar? In what direction? (c) If the bar starts out with speed vq at time t = 0, and is left to slide, what is its speed at a later time t? (d) The initial kinetic energy of the bar was, of course, ^mv o2. Check that the energy delivered i 'y to the resistor is exactly ^mvQ . Problem 7.8 A square loop of wire (side a) lies on a table, a distance s from a very long straight wire, which carries a current /, as shown in Fig. 7.17. (a) Find the flux of B through the loop.

Justify this apparent oversight. Problem 7.10 A square loop (side a) is mounted on a vertical shaft and rotated at angular velocity w (Fig. 7.18). A uniform magnetic field B points to the right. Find the £(t) for this alternating current generator. Problem 7.11 A square loop is cut out of a thick sheet of aluminum. It is then placed so that the top portion is in a uniform magnetic field B, and allowed to fall under gravity (Fig. 7.19). (In the diagram, shading indicates the field region; B points into the page.) If the magnetic field is 1 T (a pretty standard laboratory field), find the terminal velocity of the loop (in m/s). Find the velocity of the loop as a function of time. How long does it take (in seconds) to reach, sa\\. 90% of the terminal velocity? What would happen if you cut a tiny slit in the ring, breaking the circuit? [Note: The dimensions of the loop cancel out; determine the actual numbers, in the units indicated.] \".2 Electromagnetic Induction 7.2.1 Faraday’s Law In 1831 Michael Faraday reported on a series of experiments, including three that (with some violence to history) can be characterized as follows: Experiment 1. He pulled a loop of wire to the right through a magnetic field (Fig. 7.20a). A current flowed in the loop. Experiment 2. He moved the magnet to the left, holding the loop still (Fig. 7.20b). Again, a current flowed in the loop. Experiment 3. With both the loop and the magnet at rest (Fig. 7.20c), he changed the strength of the field (he used an electromagnet, and varied the current in the coil). Once again, current flowed in the loop. changing magnetic field Figure 7.20 302 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS The first experiment, of course, is an example of motional emf, conveniently expressed by the flux rule: d<t> £ =- . dt I don’t think it will surprise you to learn that exactly the same emf arises in Experiment 2— all that really matters is the relative motion of the magnet and the loop. Indeed, in the light of special relativity is has to be so. But Faraday knew nothing of relativity, and in classical electrodynamics this simple reciprocity is a coincidence, with remarkable implications. For if the loop moves, it’s a magnetic force that sets up the emf, but if the loop is stationary. the force cannot be magnetic—stationary charges experience no magnetic forces. In that case, what is responsible? What sort of field exerts a force on charges at rest? Well, electric fields do, of course, but in this case there doesn’t seem to be any electric field in sight. Faraday had an ingenious inspiration: A changing magnetic field induces an electric field. It is this “induced” electric field that accounts for the emf in Experiment 2.6 Indeed, if (as Faraday found empirically) the emf is again equal to the rate of change of the flux, £ f d<t> Edl =- , dt then E is related to the change in B by the equation 3B dt   da. (7.14) (7.15) This is Faraday’s law, in integral form. We can convert it to differential form by applying Stokes’ theorem: V x E = - 9B ~dt' (7.16) Note that Faraday’s law reduces to the old rule (fE   dl = 0 (or, in differential form. V x E = 0) in the static case (constant B) as, of course, it should. In Experiment 3 the magnetic field changes for entirely different reasons, but according to Faraday’s law an electric field will again be induced, giving rise to an emf —d<I>/dt. Indeed, one can subsume all three cases (and for that matter any combination of them) into a kind of universal flux rule: Whenever (and for whatever reason) the magnetic flux through a loop changes, an emf d® dt (7.17) will appear in the loop. 6You might argue that the magnetic field in Experiment 2 is not really changing—just moving. What I mean i-. that if you sit at a fixed location, the held does change, as the magnet passes by. 7.2. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 303 Many people call this “Faraday’s law.” Maybe I’m overly fastidious, but I find this confus¬ ing. There are really two totally different mechanisms underlying Eq. 7.17, and to identify them both as “Faraday’s law” is a little like saying that because identical twins look alike we ought to call them by the same name. In Faraday’s first experiment it’s the Lorentz force law at work; the emf is magnetic. But in the other two it’s an electric field (induced by the changing magnetic field) that does the job. Viewed in this light, it is quite astonishing that all three processes yield the same formula for the emf. In fact, it was precisely this “coincidence” that led Einstein to the special theory of relativity—he sought a deeper un¬ derstanding of what is, in classical electrodynamics, a peculiar accident. But that’s a story for Chapter 12. In the meantime I shall reserve the term “Faraday’s law” for electric fields induced by changing magnetic fields, and I do not regard Experiment 1 as an instance of Faraday’s law. Example 7.5 A long cylindrical magnet of length L and radius a carries a uniform magnetization M parallel to its axis. It passes at constant velocity v through a circular wire ring of slightly larger diameter (Fig. 7.21). Graph the emf induced in the ring, as a function of time. L Figure 7.21 Solution: The magnetic field is the same as that of a long solenoid with surface current K/, — M 4>. So the field inside is B = uqM, except near the ends, where it starts to spread out. The flux through the ring is zero when the magnet is far away; it builds up to a maximum of fu.QMna2 as the leading end passes through; and it drops back to zero as the trailing end emerges (Fig. 7.22a). The emf is (minus) the derivative of 4> with respect to time, so it consists of two spikes, as shown in Fig. 7.22b. Keeping track of the signs in Faraday’s law can be a real headache. For instance, in Ex. 7.5 we would like to know which way around the ring the induced current flows. In principle, the right-hand rule does the job (we called $ positive to the left, in Fig. 7.22a, so the positive direction for current in the ring is counterclockwise, as viewed from the left; since the first spike in Fig. 7.22b is negative, the first current pulse flows clockwise, and the second counterclockwise). But there’s a handy rule, called Lenz’s law, whose sole purpose is to help you get the directions right:7 7Lenz’s law applies to motional emf’s, too, but for them it is usually easier to get the direction of the current from the Lorentz force law. 304 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS Figure 7.22 Nature abhors a change in flux. The induced current will flow in such a direction that the flux it produces tends to cancel the change. (As the front end of the magnet in Ex. 7.5 enters the ring, the flux increases, so the current in the ring must generate a field to the right—it therefore flows clockwise.) Notice that it is the change in flux, not the flux itself, that nature abhors (when the tail end of the magnet exits the ring, the flux drops, so the induced current flows counterclockwise, in an effort to restore it). Faraday induction is a kind of “inertial” phenomenon: A conducting loop “likes” to maintain a constant flux through it; if you try to change the flux, the loop responds by sending a current around in such a direction as to frustrate your efforts. (It doesn’t succeed completely; the flux produced by the induced current is typically only a tiny fraction of the original. All Lenz’s law tells you is the direction of the flow.) Example 7.6 The “jumping ring” demonstration. If you wind a solenoidal coil around an iron core (the iron is there to beef up the magnetic field), place a metal ring on top, and plug it in, the ring will jump several feet in the air (Fig. 7.23). Why? Solution: Before you turned on the current, the flux through the ring was zero. Afterward a flux appeared (upward, in the diagram), and the emf generated in the ring led to a current (in the ring) which, according to Lenz’s law, was in such a direction that its field tended to cancel this new flux. This means that the current in the loop is opposite to the current in the solenoid. And opposite currents repel, so the ring flies off.8 8 For further discussion of the jumping ring (and the related “floating ring”), see C. S. Schneider and J. P. Ertel. Am. J. Phys. 66, 686 (1998). 7.2 ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 305 ring solenoid Figure 7.23 Problem 7.12 A long solenoid, of radius a, is driven by an alternating current, so that the field inside is sinusoidal: B(t) = Bq cosfwt) z. A circular loop of wire, of radius a/2 and resistance R, is placed inside the solenoid, and coaxial with it. Find the current induced in the loop, as a function of time. Problem 7.13 A square loop of wire, with sides of length a, lies in the first quadrant of the xy plane, with one comer at the origin. In this region there is a nonuniform time-dependent magnetic field B(y, t) = ky3t 2 z (where A is a constant). Find the emf induced in the loop. Problem 7.14 As a lecture demonstration a short cylindrical bar magnet is dropped down a vertical aluminum pipe of slightly larger diameter, about 2 meters long. It takes several seconds to emerge at the bottom, whereas an otherwise identical piece of unmagnetized iron makes the trip in a fraction of a second. Explain why the magnet falls more slowly. 7.2.2 The Induced Electric Field What Faraday’s discovery tells us is that there are really two distinct kinds of electric fields: those attributable directly to electric charges, and those associated with changing magnetic fields.9 The former can be calculated (in the static case) using Coulomb’s law; the latter can be found by exploiting the analogy between Faraday’s law, V x E = - 3B ~dt’ 9 You could, I suppose, introduce an entirely new word to denote the field generated by a changing B. Electro¬ dynamics would then involve three fields: E-fields, produced by electric charges [V-E = (l/eglp, V xE = 0]; B-fields, produced by electric currents [ V   B = 0, V x B = uoJb and G-fields, produced by changing magnetic fields [V   G = 0, V x G = —3B/3f], Because E and G exert forces in the same way [F = g(E + G)], it is tidier to regard their sum as a single entity and call the whole thing “the electric field.” 306 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS and Ampere’s law, VxB = hqJ. Of course, the curl alone is not enough to determine a field—you must also specify the divergence. But as long as E is a pure Faraday field, due exclusively to a changing B (with p = 0), Gauss’s law says V - E = 0, while for magnetic fields, of course, V -B = 0 always. So the parallel is complete, and I conclude that Faraday-induced electric fields are determined by —(3B/31) in exactly the same way as magnetostatic fields are determined by /x0J. In particular, if symmetry permits, we can use all the tricks associated with Ampere's law in integral form, (f) B • d\\ — /T()/enc> only this time it’s Faraday’s law in integral form: E • dl — — - d<J> dt (7.18) The rate of change of (magnetic) flux through the Amperian loop plays the role formerh assigned to //o4nc- Example 7.7 A uniform magnetic field B(t), pointing straight up, fills the shaded circular region of Fig. 7.24. If B is changing with time, what is the induced electric field? Solution: E points in the circumferential direction, just like the magnetic field inside a long straight wire carrying a uniform current density. Draw an Amperian loop of radius s, and apply Faraday’s law: f dQ d / 9 \\ jdB <t>E-dl = E(2ns) = —- = —- Us zS (f) = -7tsz — . J dt dt V / dt Therefore E s dB * - <p 2 dt If B is increasing, E runs clockwise, as viewed from above. Example 7.8 A line charge X is glued onto the rim of a wheel of radius b, which is then suspended horizontalh. as shown in Fig. 7.25, so that it is free to rotate (the spokes are made of some nonconducting material—wood, maybe). In the central region, out to radius a, there is a uniform magnetic field Bp, pointing up. Now someone turns the field off. What happens? 7.2. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 307 B(0 Figure 7.24 Solution: The changing magnetic field will induce an electric field, curling around the axis of the wheel. This electric field exerts a force on the charges at the rim, and the wheel starts to turn. According to Lenz s law, it will rotate in such a direction that its field tends to restore the upward flux. The motion, then, is counterclockwise, as viewed from above. Quantitatively, Faraday’s law says , d<b E • dl =- dt dB dt Now, the torque on a segment of length d\\ is (r x F), or bXEdl. The total torque on the wheel is therefore N = bX (j) E dl = —bXna2 —-, J dt and the angular momentum imparted to the wheel is f Ndt = —Xita^b f dB = Xna^bB^. J Jb 0 It doesn’t matter how fast or slow you turn off the field; the ultimate angular velocity of the wheel is the same regardless. (If you find yourself wondering where this angular momentum came from, you’re getting ahead of the story! Wait for the next chapter.) A final word on this example: It’s the electric field that did the rotating. To convince you of this I deliberately set things up so that the magnetic field is always zero at the location of the charge (on the rim). The experimenter may tell you she never put in any electric fields—all she did was switch off the magnetic field. But when she did that, an electric field automatically appeared, and it’s this electric field that turned the wheel. 308 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS I must warn you, now, of a small fraud that tarnishes many applications of Faraday’s law: Electromagnetic induction, of course, occurs only when the magnetic fields are changing, and yet we would like to use the apparatus of magneto.vfaf/r.v (Ampere’s law, the Biot-Savart law, and the rest) to calculate those magnetic fields. Technically, any result derived in this way is only approximately correct. But in practice the error is usually negligible unless the field fluctuates extremely rapidly, or you are interested in points very far from the source. Even the case of a wire snipped by a pair of scissors (Prob. 7.18) is static enough for Ampere’s law to apply. This regime, in which magnetostatic rules can be used to calculate the magnetic field on the right hand side of Faraday’s law, is called quasistatic. Generally speaking, it is only when we come to electromagnetic waves and radiation that we must worry seriously about the breakdown of magnetostatics itself. Example 7.9 An infinitely long straight wire carries a slowly varying current /(f). Determine the induced electric field, as a function of the distance ,v from the wire.10 -- l -- ! u— Amperian loop I Figure 7.26 Solution: In the quasistatic approximation, the magnetic field is (hqI/2ns), and it circles around the wire. Like the B-field of a solenoid, E here runs parallel to the axis. For the rectangular “Amperian loop” in Fig. 7.26, Faraday’s law gives: E • dl d f = E(s0)l - E(s)l =- / B da dt J Hol dl f s 1 , HOl dl 2n dt f Js0 — ds = — - In dt (Ini' — lni'o). Thus E(.s) = ^-^-Xns + K In dt (7.191 where K is a constant (that is to say, it is independent of i—it might still be a function of t). The actual value of K depends on the whole history of the function 7(f)—we’ll see some examples in Chapter 10. 10This example is artificial, and not just in the usual sense of involving infinite wires, but in a more subtle respect. It assumes that the current is the same (at any given instant) all the way down the line. This is a safe assumption for the short wires in typical electric circuits, but not (in practice) for long wires (transmission lines), unless you supply a distributed and synchronized driving mechanism. But never mind—the problem doesn’t inquire how you would produce such a current; it only asks what fields would result if you did. (Variations on this problem are discussed in M. A. Heald, Am. J. Phys. 54, 1142 (1986), and references cited therein.) 7.2. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 309 Equation 7.19 has the peculiar implication that E blows up as s goes to infinity. That can’t be true ... What’s gone wrong? Answer: We have overstepped the limits of the quasistatic approximation. As we shall see in Chapter 9, electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light, and at large distances B depends not on the current now, but on the current as it was at some earlier time (indeed, a whole range of earlier times, since different points on the wire are different distances away). If r is the time it takes I to change substantially, then the quasistatic approximation should hold only for s « cr, (7.20) and hence Eq. 7.19 simply does not apply, at extremely large s. Problem 7.15 A long solenoid with radius a and n turns per unit length carries a time-dependent current / (0 in the $ direction. Find the electric field (magnitude and direction) at a distance s from the axis (both inside and outside the solenoid), in the quasistatic approximation. Problem 7.16 An alternating current I = /q cos (tot) flows down a long straight wire, and returns along a coaxial conducting tube of radius a. (a) In what direction does the induced electric field point (radial, circumferential, or longitu¬ dinal)? (b) Assuming that the field goes to zero as s -*   oo, find E(,v. t). [Incidentally, this is not at all the way electric fields actually behave in coaxial cables, for reasons suggested in footnote 10. See Sect. 9.5.3, or J. G. Cherveniak, Am. J. Phys., 54, 946 (1986), for a more realistic treatment.] Problem 7.17 A long solenoid of radius a, carrying n turns per unit length, is looped by a wire with resistance R, as shown in Fig. 111. (a) If the current in the solenoid is increasing at a constant rate (dl/dt = k), what current flows in the loop, and which way (left or right) does it pass through the resistor? (b) If the current I in the solenoid is constant but the solenoid is pulled out of the loop and reinserted in the opposite direction, what total charge passes through the resistor? Figure 7.27 310 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS a Problem 7.18 A square loop, side a, resistance R, lies a distance s from an infinite straight wire that carries current I (Fig. 7.28). Now someone cuts the wire, so that I drops to zero. In what direction does the induced current in the square loop flow, and what total charge passes a given point in the loop during the time this current flows? If you don’t like the scissors model, turn the current down gradually. f (1 — at)I, for0<f<l/a, /(f)= | 0, fort > 1/a. Problem 7.19 A toroidal coil has a rectangular cross section, with inner radius a, outer radius a + w, and height h. It carries a total of N tightly wound turns, and the current is increasing at a constant rate (dl/dt = k). If w and h are both much less than a, find the electric field at a point z above the center of the toroid. [Hint: exploit the analogy between Faraday fields and magnetostatic fields, and refer to Ex. 5.6.] 7.2.3 Inductance Suppose you have two loops of wire, at rest (Fig. 7.29). If you run a steady current 1\\ around loop 1, it produces a magnetic field B|. Some of the field lines pass through loop 2; let d>2 be the flux of Bi through 2. You might have a tough time actually calculating B|. but a glance at the Biot-Savart law, fin / d\\\\ X i B| = £''/ — reveals one significant fact about this field: It is proportional to the current l\\. Therefore, so too is the flux through loop 2: d>2 j Bj -da2. 7.2. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 311 Figure 7.29 d\\2 Thus <J>2 = M 2i/i, (7.21) where M2] is the constant of proportionality; it is known as the mutual inductance of the two loops. There is a cute formula for the mutual inductance, which you can derive by expressing the flux in terms of the vector potential and invoking Stokes’ theorem: <t >2 j Bi • d&2 j (V x Ai) • da2 = Ai • dl2. Now, according to Eq. 5.63, An T ri and hence Evidently An J \\J fi M2\\ = F-0 d\\\\   dl2 (7.22) An J J >i This is the Neumann formula; it involves a double line integral—one integration around loop 1, the other around loop 2 (Fig. 7.30). It’s not very useful for practical calculations, but it does reveal two important things about mutual inductance: 1. M2i is a purely geometrical quantity, having to do with the sizes, shapes, and relative positions of the two loops. 2. The integral in Eq. 7.22 is unchanged if we switch the roles of loops 1 and 2; it follows that M21 = M\\2- (7.23) 312 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS This is an astonishing conclusion: Whatever the shapes and positions of the loops, the flux through 2 when we run a current I around I is identical to the flux through 1 when we send the same current I around 2. We may as well drop the subscripts and call them both M. Example 7.10 A short solenoid (length l and radius a, with n \\ turns per unit length) lies on the axis of a very long solenoid (radius b,n 2 turns per unit length) as shown in Fig. 7.31. Current I flows in the short solenoid. What is the flux through the long solenoid? Figure 7.31 Solution: Since the inner solenoid is short, it has a very complicated field; moreover, it puts a different amount of flux through each turn of the outer solenoid. It would be a miserable task to compute the total flux this way. However, if we exploit the equality of the mutual inductances, the problem becomes very easy. Just look at the reverse situation: run the current I through the outer solenoid, and calculate the flux through the inner one. The field inside the long solenoid is constant: B = UW21 (Eq. 5.57), so the flux through a single loop of the short solenoid is 2 2 Bna = uonilxu   There are n\\l turns in all, so the total flux through the inner solenoid is $ = p-07ta n\\n2ll. This is also the flux a current I in the short solenoid would put through the long one, which is what we set out to find. Incidentally, the mutual inductance, in this case, is M = /u,ojra n\\n2l. Suppose now that you vary the current in loop 1. The flux through loop 2 will vary accordingly, and Faraday’s law says this changing flux will induce an emf in loop 2: £2 = - d<t> 2 dt = -M dh dt (7.24) (In quoting Eq. 7.21—which was based on the Biot-Savart law—I am tacitly assuming that the currents change slowly enough for the configuration to be considered quasistatic.) What 7.2. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 313 a remarkable thing: Every time you change the current in loop 1, an induced current flows in loop 2—even though there are no wires connecting them! Come to think of it, a changing current not only induces an emf in any nearby loops, it also induces an emf in the source loop itself (Fig 7.32). Once again, the field (and therefore also the flux) is proportional to the current: <*> = LI. (7.25) The constant of proportionality L is called the self-inductance (or simply the inductance) of the loop. As with M, it depends on the geometry (size and shape) of the loop. If the current changes, the emf induced in the loop is e = - Ln - <7-26> Inductance is measured in henries (H); a henry is a volt-second per ampere. Example 7.11 Find the self-inductance of a toroidal coil with rectangular cross section (inner radius a, outer radius b, height h), which carries a total of N turns. Solution: The magnetic field inside the toroid is (Eq. 5.58) B = HO NI 2 ns The flux through a single turn (Fig. 7.33) is /Vda n- ds J 2.71 Ja S H0N Ih jn fb 2 n \\a The total flux is N times this, so the self-inductance (Eq. 7.25) is L = HO N2h 2 n In (7.27) 314 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS Figure 7.33 Inductance (like capacitance) is an intrinsically positive quantity. Lenz’s law, which is enforced by the minus sign in Eq. 7.26, dictates that the emf is in such a direction as to oppose any change in current. For this reason, it is called a back emf. Whenever you try to alter the current in a wire, you must fight against this back emf. Thus inductance plays somewhat the same role in electric circuits that mass plays in mechanical systems: The greater L is, the harder it is to change the current, just as the larger the mass, the harder it is to change an object’s velocity. Example 7.12 Suppose a current I is flowing around a loop when someone suddenly cuts the wire. The current drops “instantaneously” to zero. This generates a whopping back emf, for although I may be small, dl/dt is enormous. That’s why you often draw a spark when you unplug an iron or toaster—electromagnetic induction is desperately trying to keep the current going, even if it has to jump the gap in the circuit. Nothing so dramatic occurs when you plug in a toaster or iron. In this case induction opposes the sudden increase in current, prescribing instead a smooth and continuous buildup. Suppose, for instance, that a battery (which supplies a constant emf £q) is connected to a circuit of resistance R and inductance L (Fig. 7.34). What current flows? L e0 R Figure 7.34 7.2. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 315 Figure 7.35 Solution: The total emf in this circuit is that provided by the battery plus that resulting from the self-inductance. Ohm’s law, then, says11 „ dl £ 0- L — = IR. dt This is a first-order differential equation for / as a function of time. The general solution, as you can easily derive for yourself, is I{t)= £ A+ k e-(RIL), R where A: is a constant to be determined by the initial conditions. In particular, if the circuit is “plugged in” at time t = 0 (so 7(0) = 0), then k has the value -£q/R, and = -e~ (R/L)t]- (7.28) This function is plotted in Fig. 7.35. Had there been no inductance in the circuit, the current would have jumped immediately to £q/R. In practice, every circuit has some self-inductance, and the current approaches £q/R asymptotically. The quantity x = L/R is called the time constant; it tells you how long the current takes to reach a substantial fraction (roughly two- thirds) of its final value. Problem 7.20 A small loop of wire (radius a) lies a distance z above the center of a large loop (radius b), as shown in Fig. 7.36. The planes of the two loops are parallel, and perpendicular to the common axis. (a) Suppose current 7 flows in the big loop. Find the flux through the little loop. (The little loop is so small that you may consider the field of the big loop to be essentially constant.) (b) Suppose current 7 flows in the little loop. Find the flux through the big loop. (The little loop is so small that you may treat it as a magnetic dipole.) (c) Find the mutual inductances, and confirm that M\\2 = M 2\\. 11 Notice that —L(dl jdt) goes on the left side of the equation—it is part of the emf that (together with £0) establishes the voltage across the resistor (Eq. 7.10). 316 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS ( A ) l Figure 7.37 Problem 7.21 A square loop of wire, of side a, lies midway between two long wires, 3a apart, and in the same plane. (Actually, the long wires are sides of a large rectangular loop, but the short ends are so far away that they can be neglected.) A clockwise current I in the square loop is gradually increasing: dl/dt = k (a constant). Find the emf induced in the big loop. Which way will the induced current flow? Problem 7.22 Find the self-inductance per unit length of a long solenoid, of radius R, carrying n turns per unit length. Problem 7.23 Try to compute the self-inductance of the “hairpin” loop shown in Fig. 7.37. (Neglect the contribution from the ends; most of the flux comes from the long straight section.) You’ll run into a snag that is characteristic of many self-inductance calculations. To get a definite answer, assume the wire has a tiny radius e, and ignore any flux through the wire itself. Problem 7.24 An alternating current Iq cos (cot) (amplitude 0.5 A, frequency 60 Hz) flows down a straight wire, which runs along the axis of a toroidal coil with rectangular cross section (inner radius 1 cm, outer radius 2 cm, height 1 cm, 1000 turns). The coil is connected to a 500 £7 resistor. (a) In the quasistatic approximation, what emf is induced in the toroid? Find the current, Ir(t). in the resistor. (b) Calculate the back emf in the coil, due to the current Ir(t). What is the ratio of the amplitudes of this back emf and the “direct” emf in (a)? Problem 7.25 A capacitor C is charged up to a potential V and connected to an inductor L. as shown schematically in Fig. 7.38. At time t — 0 the switch S is closed. Find the current in the circuit as a function of time. How does your answer change if a resistor R is included in series with C and L? 7.2.4 Energy in Magnetic Fields It takes a certain amount of energy to start a current flowing in a circuit. I’m not talking about the energy delivered to the resistors and converted into heat—that is irretrievably lost as far as the circuit is concerned and can be large or small, depending on how long you let the current run. What I am concerned with, rather, is the work you must do against the back emf to get the current going. This is a fixed amount, and it is recoverable: you get it back when the current is turned off. In the meantime it represents energy latent in the circuit; as we’ll see in a moment, it can be regarded as energy stored in the magnetic field. The work done on a unit charge, against the back emf, in one trip around the circuit is -8 (the minus sign records the fact that this is the work done by you against the emf, not the work done by the emf). The amount of charge per unit time passing down the wire is I. So the total work done per unit time is dW dt = -81=LI dl dt If we start with zero current and build it up to a final value /, the work done (integrating the last equation over time) is (7.29) It does not depend on how long we take to crank up the current, only on the geometry of the loop (in the form of L) and the final current I. There is a nicer way to write W, which has the advantage that it is readily generalized to surface and volume currents. Remember that the flux <1> through the loop is equal to LI (Eq. 7.25). On the other hand, <t> = / B da = / (V xA)-da= i A • d\\, JS Js Jv where V is the perimeter of the loop and S is any surface bounded by V. Thus, Xd\\, 318 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS and therefore W = X-I j) A - d\\. The vector sign might as well go on the /: (7.30) In this form, the generalization to volume currents is obvious: W= ^ / (A.J)dr. (7.31) 2 Jv But we can do even better, and express W entirely in terms of the magnetic field: Ampere’s law, V x B = no,], lets us eliminate J: W — —5— f A • (V x B) dx. (7.32) 2mo J Integration by parts enables us to move the derivative from B to A; specifically, product rule 6 states that V • (A x B) = B • (V x A) — A • (V x B), so Consequently, A • (V x B) = B • B — V • (A x B). w = “ [/ B2 dx — j V • (A x B) dx = —— / B2 dx — ® (A x B) • da . 2/ro [Jv Js J (7.33) where S is the surface bounding the volume V. Now, the integration in Eq. 7.31 is to be taken over the entire volume occupied by the current. But any region larger than this will do just as well, for J is zero out there anyway. In Eq. 7.33 the larger the region we pick the greater is the contribution from the volume integral, and therefore the smaller is that of the surface integral (this makes sense: as the surface gets farther from the current, both A and B decrease). In particular, if we agree to integrate over all space, then the surface integral goes to zero, and we are left with W = f B2d T. Jail space (7.34) In view of this result, we say the energy is “stored in the magnetic field,” in the amount (B 2/2ho) per unit volume. This is a nice way to think of it, though someone looking at Eq. 7.31 might prefer to say that the energy is stored in the current distribution, in the 7.2. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 319 amount | (A • J) per unit volume. The distinction is one of bookkeeping; the important quantity is the total energy W, and we shall not worry about where (if anywhere) the energy is “located.” You might find it strange that is takes energy to set up a magnetic field—after all, magnetic fields themselves do no work. The point is that producing a magnetic field, where previously there was none, requires changing the field, and a changing B-field, according to Faraday, induces an electric field. The latter, of course, can do work. In the beginning there is no E, and at the end there is no E; but in between, while B is building up, there is an E, and it is against this that the work is done. (You see why I could not calculate the energy stored in a magnetostatic field back in Chapter 5.) In the light of this, it is extraordinary how similar the magnetic energy formulas are to their electrostatic counterparts: Welec = 2 /= Y J E 2 dx > (2.43 and 2.45) fkmag = X~ j (A   J)dr = j B2 dr. (7.31 and 7.34) Example 7.13 A long coaxial cable carries current I (the current flows down the surface of the inner cylinder, radius a, and back along the outer cylinder, radius b) as shown in Fig. 7.39. Find the magnetic energy stored in a section of length /. Figure 7.39 Solution: According to Ampere’s law, the field between the cylinders is 2ns Elsewhere, the field is zero. Thus, the energy per unit volume is 1 / hO[\\ 2 _ ho I2 2^q\\2jzs) 8n2s2 The energy in a cylindrical shell of length /, radius s, and thickness ds, then, is / ho I2 \\8n 2s2 2nls ds = 4tt 320 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS Integrating from a to b, we have: W = By the way, this suggests a very simple way to calculate the self-inductance of the cable. According to Eq. 7.29, the energy can also be written as jLI 2. Comparing the two expres- 12 sions. L = b a This method of calculating self-inductance is especially useful when the current is not confined to a single path, but spreads over some surface or volume. In such cases different parts of the current may circle different amounts of flux, and it can be very tricky to get L directly from Eq. 7.25. Prpblem 7.26 Find the energy stored in a section of length l of a long solenoid (radius R. current /, n turns per unit length), (a) using Eq. 7.29 (you found L in Prob. 7.22); (b) using Eq. 7.30 (we worked out A in Ex. 5.12); (c) using Eq. 7.34; (d) using Eq. 7.33 (take as your volume the cylindrical tube from radius a < R out to radius b > R). Problem 7.27 Calculate the energy stored in the toroidal coil of Ex. 7.11, by applying Eq. 7.34. Use the answer to check Eq. 7.27. Problem 7.28 A long cable carries current in one direction uniformly distributed over its (circular) cross section. The current returns along the surface (there is a very thin insulating sheath separating the currents). Find the self-inductance per unit length. Problem 7.29 Suppose the circuit in Fig. 7.40 has been connected for a long time when suddenly, at time t = 0, switch S is thrown, bypassing the battery. L R 12Notice the similarity to Eq. 7.27—in a sense, the rectangular toroid is a short coaxial cable, turned on its side. 7.3. MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS 321 Figure 7.41 (a) What is the current at any subsequent time t? (b) What is the total energy delivered to the resistor? (c) Show that this is equal to the energy originally stored in the inductor. Problem 7.30 Two tiny wire loops, with areas a | and a2, are situated a displacement 4 apart (Fig. 7.41). (a) Find their mutual inductance. [Hint: Treat tjiem as magnetic dipoles, and use Eq. 5.87.] Is your formula consistent with Eq. 7.23? (b) Suppose a current l\\ is flowing in loop 1, and we propose to turn on a current Ij in loop 2. How much work must be done, against the mutually induced emf, to keep the current I\\ flowing in loop 1? In light of this result, comment on Eq. 6.35. 7.3 Maxwell’s Equations 7.3.1 Electrodynamics Before Maxwell So far, we have encountered the following laws, specifying the divergence and curl of electric and magnetic fields: (i) V - E = —p £0 (Gauss’s law), (ii) V B = 0 (no name), (iii) 9B V x E =- dt (Faraday’s law), (iv) V x B = ii qJ (Ampere’s law). These equations represent the state of electromagnetic theory over a century ago, when Maxwell began his work. They were not written in so compact a form in those days, but their physical content was familiar. Now, it happens there is a fatal inconsistency in these 322 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS formulas. It has to do with the old rule that divergence of curl is always zero. If you apph the divergence to number (iii), everything works out: V.(V„B-V.(-£)—i(V.B,. The left side is zero because divergence of curl is zero; the right side is zero by virtue of equation (ii). But when you do the same thing to number (iv), you get into trouble: V • (V x B) = /ro(V • J); (7.35i the left side must be zero, but the right side, in general, is not. For steady currents, the divergence of J is zero, but evidently when we go beyond magnetostatics Ampere’s law cannot be right. There’s another way to see that Ampere’s law is bound to fail for nonsteady currents. Suppose we’re in the process of charging up a capacitor (Fig. 7.42). In integral form. Ampere’s law reads (j) B • d\\ — /To/ enc- I want to apply it to the Amperian loop shown in the diagram. How do I determine / enc Well, it’s the total current passing through the loop, or, more precisely, the current piercing a surface that has the loop for its boundary. In this case, the simplest surface lies in the plane of the loop—the wire punctdres this surface, so / enc = I. Fine—but what if I draw instead the balloon-shaped surface in Fig. 7.42? No current passes through this surface, and I conclude that / enc = 0! We never had this problem in magnetostatics because the conflict arises only when charge is piling up somewhere (in this case, on the capacitor plates). But for nonsteady currents (such as this one) “the current enclosed hy a loop ” is an ill-defined notion, since it depends entirely oh what surface you use. (If this seems pedantic to you— “obviously one should use the planar surface”—remember that the Amperian loop could be some contorted shape that doesn’t even lie in a plane.) Battery Figure 7.42 7.3. MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS 323 Of course, we had no right to expect Ampere’s law to hold outside of magnetostatics; after all, we derived it from the Biot-Savart law. However, in Maxwell’s time there was no experimental reason to doubt that Ampere’s law was of wider validity. The flaw was a purely theoretical one, and Maxwell fixed it by purely theoretical arguments. 7.3.2 How Maxwell Fixed Ampere’s Law The problem is on the right side of Eq. 7.35, which should he zero, but isn’t. Applying the continuity equation (5.29) and Gauss’s law, the offending term can be rewritten: dp 3 VJ = -87 = -S <e»VE ) = 3E\\ 60 ~dt) ' It might occur to you that if we were to combine eo(9E/31) with J, in Ampere’s law, it would be just right to kill off the extra divergence: V X B = /Lt0J + Hq€q 31 (7.36) (Maxwell himself had other reasons for wanting to add this quantity to Ampere’s law. To him the rescue of the continuity equation was a happy dividend rather than a primary motive. But today we recognize this argument as a far more compelling one than Maxwell’s, which was based on a now-discredited model of the ether.)13 Such a modification changes nothing, as far as magneto statics is concerned: when E is constant, we still have V x B = /roJ. In fact, Maxwell’s term is hard to detect in ordinary electromagnetic experiments, where it must compete for recognition with J; that’s why Faraday and the others never discovered it in the laboratory. However, it plays a crucial role in the propagation of electromagnetic waves, as we’ll see in Chapter 9. Apart from curing the defect in Ampere’s law, Maxwell’s term has a certain aesthetic appeal: Just as a changing magnetic field induces an electric field (Faraday’s law), so A changing electric field induces a magnetic field. Of course, theoretical convenience and aesthetic consistency are only suggestive—there might, after all, be other ways to doctor up Ampere’s law. The real confirmation of Maxwell’s theory came in 1888 with Hertz’s experiments on electromagnetic waves. Maxwell called his extra term the displacement current: 3E —• (7.37) at It’s a misleading name, since eo(9E/3t) has nothing to do with current, except that it adds to J in Ampere’s law. Let’s see now how the displacement current resolves the paradox of the charging capacitor (Fig. 7.42). If the capacitor plates are very close together (I didn’t l3For the history of this subject, see A. M. Bork. Am. J. Phys. 31, 854 (1963). 324 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS draw them that way, but the calculation is simpler if you assume this), then the electric field between them is *=Ia = ie fo co A where Q is the charge on the plate and A is its area. Thus, between the plates 3 E 1 dQ 1 31 dt e0A Now, Eq. 7.36 reads, in integral form. / B • r/1 — MO^enc + MO Co • da. (7.38) If we choose thenar surface, then E = 0 and 7enc = /. If, on the other hand, we use the balloon-shaped surface, then 7enc = 0, but /(3E/3f) • da = I/e {). So we get the same answer for either surface, though in the first case it comes from the genuine current and in the second from the displacement current. Problem 7.31 A fat wire, radius a, carries a constant current /, uniformly distributed over its cross section. A narrow gap in the wire, of width w « a, forms a parallel-plate capacitor, as shown in Fig. 7.43. Find the magnetic field in the gap, at a distance s < a from the axis. w Figure 7.43 Problem 7.32 The preceding problem was an artificial model for the charging capacitor, de¬ signed to avoid complications associated with the current spreading out over the surface of the plates. For a more realistic model, imagine thin wires that connect to the centers of the plates (Fig. 7.44a). Again, the current I is constant, the radius of the capacitor is a, and the separation of the plates is w << a. Assume that the current flows out over the plates in such a way that the surface charge is uniform, at any given time, and is zero at t = 0. (a) Find the electric field between the plates, as a function of t. 7.3. MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS 325 Figure 7.44 (b) Find the displacement current through a circle of radius y in the plane midway between the plates. Using this circle as your “Amperian loop,” and the flat surface that spans it, find the magnetic field at a distance s from the axis. (c) Repeat part (b), but this time use the cylindrical surface in Fig. 7.44b, which extends to the left through the plate and terminates outside the capacitor. Notice that the displacement current through this surface is zero, and there are two contributions to /enc.14 Problem 7.33 Refer to Prob. 7.16, to which the correct answer was E(,,0 = ^ s inM)ln(-U 2 n \\s / (a) Find the displacement current density ,]r/.

If the outer cylinder were, say, 2 mm in diameter, how high would the frequency have to be, for /</ to be 1% of /? [This problem is designed to indicate why Faraday never discovered displacement currents, and why it is ordinarily safe to ignore them unless the frequency is extremely high.] 14This problem raises an interesting quasi-philosophical question: If you measure B in the laboratory, have you detected the effects of displacement current (as (b) would suggest), or merely confirmed the effects of ordinary currents (as (c) implies)? See D. F. Bartlett, Am. J. Phys. 58, 1168 (1990). 326 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS 7.3.3 Maxwell’s Equations In the last section we put the finishing touches on Maxwell’s equations: (i) V • E = —p co (Gauss’s law), (ii) V • B = 0 (no name), (iii) V x E = — — dt (Faraday’s law), 9E (iv) VxB = /x0J 4 - ftQ€o — at (Ampere’s law with Maxwell’s correction). Together with the force law, F = q(E + v x B), (7.40) they summarize the entire theoretical content of classical electrodynamics15 (save for some special properties of matter, which we encountered in Chapters 4 and 6). Even the continuitx equation, dp vj = --. (7.41, which is the mathematical expression of conservation of charge, can be derived from Maxwell’s equations by applying the divergence to number (iv). I have written Maxwell’s equations in the traditional way, which emphasizes that the\\ specify the divergence and curl of E and B. In this form they reinforce the notion that electric fields can be produced either by charges (p) or by changing magnetic fields (9B/9?), and magnetic fields can be produced either by currents (J) or by changing electric fields (9E/9n. Actually, this is somewhat misleading, because when you come right down to it 9B/9t and 9E/9f are themselves due to charges and currents. I think it is logically preferable to write 1 r)R (i) V • E = —p, (iii) V x E H-= 0, cq dt (ii) V • B = 0, 9E (iv) V x B - h 0€q— = /r0J, at (7.42) with the fields (E and B) on the left and the sources (p and J) on the right. This notation emphasizes that all electromagnetic fields are ultimately attributable to charges and currents. Maxwell’s equations tell you how charges produce fields', reciprocally, the force law tells you hem fields affect charges. 15Like any differential equations, Maxwell’s must be supplemented by suitable boundary conditions. Because these are typically “obvious” from the context (e.g. E and B go to zero at large distances from a localized charge distribution), it is easy to forget that they play an essential role. 7.3. MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS 327 Problem 7.34 Suppose E(r, f) = — -- \\ 6(vt-r)r; B(r, t) = 0 47t€q r L (the theta function is defined in Prob. 1.45b). Show that these fields satisfy all of Maxwell’s equations, and determine p and J. Describe the physical situation that gives rise to these fields. 7.3.4 Magnetic Charge There is a pleasing symmetry about Maxwell’s equations; it is particularly striking in free space, where p and J vanish: V - E = 0, V x E = — 9B Jt’ V • B = 0, v, 9E V x B = iiQeo —   at If you replace E by B and B by —iiq€qE, the first pair of equations turns into the second, and vice versa. This symmetry16 between E and B is spoiled, though, by the charge term in Gauss’s law and the current term in Ampere’s law. You can’t help wondering why the corresponding quantities are “missing” from V • B = 0 and V x E = -9B/9f. What if we had (i) V • E = —pe, £0 (iii) V x E = -/r 0J m 9B dt (ii) V B = ix0p m, 9E (iv) V X B = HoJe + IX0€ 0 —. at (7.43) Then pm would represent the density of magnetic “charge,” and pe the density of electric charge; J m would be the current of maghetic charge, and J e the current of electric charge. Both charges would be conserved: V • J m — and V • Je = (7.44) dt dt The former follows by application of the divergence to (iii), the latter by taking the diver¬ gence of (iv). In a sense, Maxwell’s equations beg for magnetic charge to exist—it would fit in so nicely. And yet, in spite of a diligent search, no one has ever found any.17 As far as we know, pm is zero everywhere, and so is J m; B is not on equal footing with E: there exist 16Don’t be distracted by the pesky constants po and cq: these are present Only because the SI system measures E and B in different units, and would not occur, for instance, iti the Gaussian system. 17For an extensive bibliography, see A. S. Goldhaber and W. P. Trower, Am. J. Phys. 58, 429 (1990). 328 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS stationary sources for E (electric charges) but none for B. (This is reflected in the fact that magnetic multipole expansions have no monopole term, and magnetic dipoles consist of current loops, not separated north and south “poles.”) Apparently God just didn’t make any magnetic charge. (In the quantum theory of electrodynamics, by the way, it’s a more than merely aesthetic shame that magnetic charge does not seem to exist: Dirac showed that the existence of magnetic charge would explain why electric charge is quantized. See Prob. 8.12.) Problem 7.35 Assuming that “Coulomb’s law” for magnetic charges (qm) reads F= t xoqjn1q mli ' 4 n n.1 work out the force law for a monopole qm moving with velocity v through electric and magnetic fields E and B. [For interesting commentary, see W. Rindler, Am. J. Phys. 57, 993 (1989).] Problem 7.36 Suppose a magnetic monopole qm passes through a resistanceless loop of wire with self-inductance L. What current is induced in the loop? [This is one of the methods used to search for monopoles in the laboratory; see B. Cabrera, Phys. Rev. Lett. 48, 1378 (1982).] 7.3.5 Maxwell’s Equations in Matter Maxwell’s equations in the form 7.39 are complete and correct as they stand. However, when you are working with materials that are subject to electric and magnetic polarization there is a more convenient way to write them. For inside polarized matter there will be accumulations of “bound” charge and current over which you exert no direct control. It would be nice to reformulate Maxwell’s equations in such a way as to make explicit reference only to those sources we control directly: the “free” charges and currents. We have already learned, from the static case, that an electric polarization P produces a bound charge density pb = -V • P (7.46) (Eq. 4.12). Likewise, a magnetic polarization (or “magnetization”) M results in a bound current Ji = VxM (7.47) (Eq. 6.13). There’s just one new feature to consider in the nonstatic case: Any change in the electric polarization involves a flow of (bound) charge (call it J /;). which must be included in the total current. For suppose we examine a tiny chunk of polarized material (Fig. 7.45.) The polarization introduces a charge density Ob = P at one end and - 07, at the other (Eq. 4.11). If P now increases a bit, the charge on each end increases accordingly, giving a net current dl = dab 31 J 3 P da± = — da±. 31 7.3. MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS 329 Figure 7.45 The current density, therefore, is (7.48) This polarization current has nothing whatever to do with the bound current J/,. The latter is associated with magnetization of the material and involves the spin and orbital motion of electrons; J p, by contrast, is the result of the linear motion of charge when the electric polarization changes. If P points to the right and is increasing, then each plus charge moves a bit to the right and each minus charge to the left; the cumulative effect is the polarization current J p. In this connection, we ought to check that Eq. 7.48 is consistent with the continuity equation: V • J p = V • ^ = -(V • P) = dt dt dt Yes: The continuity equation is satisfied; in fact, ] p is essential to account for the con¬ servation of bound charge. (Incidentally, a changing magnetization does not lead to any analogous accumulation of charge or current. The bound current J b = V x M varies in response to changes in M, to be sure, but that’s about it.) In view of all this, the total charge density can be separated into two parts: P = Pf + Pb - Pf ~ V • P, and the current density into three parts: 9P J — J/+Jfo + Jp — J/ + V xM-j-. dt Gauss’s law can now be written as V • E = — (pf- V-P), €0 or v - D = pf , where D, as in the static case, is given by (7.49) (7.50) (7.51) D = e0E + P. (7.52) 7.3. MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS 331 7.3.6 Boundary Conditions In general, the fields E, B, D, and H will be discontinuous at a boundary between two different media, or at a surface that carries charge density a or current density K. The explicit form of these discontinuities can be deduced from Maxwell’s equations (7.55), in their integral form (i) £v-da=Q fenc (ii) (J) B • da = 0 over any closed surface S. (iii) 6 Edl = -4- [ B da Jr dt Js (iv) fp H dl= '.U + Applying (i) to a tiny, wafer-thin Gaussian pillbox extending just slightly into the material on either side of the boundary, we obtain (Fig. 7.46): for any surface S bounded by the closed loop V. Dj • a — D2 • a = Of a. (The positive direction for a is from 2 toward 1. The edge of the wafer contributes nothing in the limit as the thickness goes to zero, nor does any volume change density.) Thus, the component of D that is perpendicular to the interface is discontinuous in the amount Dj~ - Dj; = a/. (7.59) Figure 7.46 332 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS Figure 7.47 Identical reasoning, applied to equation (ii), yields Bf = 0. (7.60) Turning to (iii), a very thin Amperian loop straddling the surface (Fig. 7.47) gives Ei 1-E 2 1= [ B -da. dtJs But in the limit as the width of the loop goes to zero, the flux vanishes. (I have already dropped the contribution of the two ends to § E • d\\, on the same grounds.) Therefore, e\\ - e\\ = 0. (7.61) That is, the components of E parallel to the interface are continuous across the boundary. By the same token, (iv) implies Hi * - H2 1 = 7/enc, where If tnc is the free current passing through the Amperian loop. No volume current density will contribute (in the limit of infinitesimal width) but a surface current can. In fact, if n is a unit vector perpendicular to the interface (pointing from 2 toward 1), so that (n x 1) is normal to the Amperian loop, then 7/enc = K/ • (n x 1) = (Kf x n) • 1, and hence Hj - hJJ = Kf x n. (7.62) So the parallel components of H are discontinuous by an amount proportional to the free surface current density. 7.3. MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS 333 Equations 7.59-62 are the general boundary conditions for electrodynamics. In the case of linear media, they can be expressed in terms of E and B alone: (i) €\\E^ - €2E $ = o f , (iii) Ej - Eij = 0, (ii) Bf- - B 2 — 0, (iv) — B'1- B\" =K f xn. Ml M2 (7.63) In particular, if there is no free charge or free current at the interface, then (i) eiE; 1- - €2e £ = 0, (iii) e} - E^ = 0, (ii) - B 2 = 0, (iv) —fi! 1 - —fiJJ = 0. Ml M2 (7.64) As we shall see in Chapter 9, these equations are the basis for the theory of reflection and refraction. More Problems on Chapter 7 Problem 7.38 Two very large metal plates are held a distance d apart, one at potential zero, the other at potential V0 (Fig. 7.48).

The two ends are flat, and are taken to be equipotentials. The suggested method is to slice it into circular disks of width dz, find the resistance of each disk, and integrate to get the total.

Calculate the emf developed between the “north pole” and the equator. [Answer: jBQCoa2] Problem 7.46 Refer to Prob. 7.11 (and use the result of Prob. 5.40, if it helps): (a) Does the square ring fall faster in the orientation shown (Fig. 7.19), or when rotated 45c about an axis coming out of the page? Find the ratio of the two terminal velocities. If you dropped the loop, which orientation would it assume in falling? [Answer: (s/2 — 2y/l)~. where Z is the length of a side, and y is the height of the center above the edge of the magnetic- field, in the rotated configuration.] (b) How long does is take a circular ring to cross the bottom of the magnetic field, at its (changing) terminal velocity?

Find the electric field inside and outside the sphere. [Hint: There are two contributions here: the Coulomb field due to the charge, and the Faraday field due to the changing B. Refer to Ex. 5.11, and use Eq. 7.66.] Problem 7.48 Electrons undergoing cyclotron motion can be speeded up by increasing the magnetic field; the accompanying electric field will impart tangential acceleration. This is the principle of the betatron. One would like to keep the radius of the orbit constant during the process. Show that this can be achieved by designing a magnet such that the average field over the area of the orbit is twice the field at the circumference (Fig. 7.52). Assume the electrons start from rest in zero field, and that the apparatus is symmetric about the center of the orbit. (Assume also that the electron velocity remains well below the speed of light, so that nonrelativistic mechanics applies.) [Hint: differentiate Eq. 5.3 with respect to time, and use F = ma = qE.] 7.3. MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS 335 Figure 7.51 A superconductor is a perfect conductor with the additional property that the (constant) B inside is in fact zero. (This “flux exclusion” is known as the Meissner effect.18) (c) Show that the current in a superconductor is confined to the surface. (d) Superconductivity is lost above a certain critical temperature (T c), which varies from one material to another. Suppose you had a sphere (radius a) above its critical temperature, and you held it in a uniform magnetic field Bqz while cooling it below Tc. Find the induced surface current density K, as a function of the polar angle 0. Problem 7.43 A familiar demonstration of superconductivity (Prob. 7.42) is the levitation of a magnet over a piece of superconducting material. This phenomenon can be analyzed using the method of images.19 Treat the magnet as a perfect dipole m, a height z above the origin (and constrained to point in the z direction), and pretend that the superconductor occupies the entire half-space below the xy plane. Because of the Meissner effect, B = 0 for z < 0, and since B is divergenceless, the normal (z) component is continuous, so Bz = 0 just above the surface. This boundary condition is met by the image configuration in which an identical dipole is placed at -z, as a stand-in for the superconductor; the two arrangements therefore produce the same magnetic field in the region z > 0. (a) Which way should the image dipole point (+z or -z)? (b) Find the force on the magnet due to the induced currents in the superconductor (which is to say, the force due to the image dipole). Set it equal to Mg (where M is the mass of the magnet) to determine the height h at which the magnet will “float.” [Hint: refer to Prob. 6.3.] 18The Meissner effect is sometimes referred to as “perfect diamagnetism,” in the sense that the field inside is not merely reduced, but canceled entirely. However, the surface currents responsible for this are free, not bound, so the actual mechanism is quite different. 19W. M. Saslow, Am, J. Phys. 59, 16 (1991). 334 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS Figure 7.50 (a) Calculate R this way. (b) Explain why this method is fundamentally flawed. [See J. D. Romano and R. H. Price, Am. J.

Phys. 52, 522 (1984)]: Imagine an infinite!) long cylindrical sheet, of uniform resistivity and radius a. A slot (corresponding to the batters) is maintained at ±Vq/2, at 0 = ±n, and a steady current flows over the surface, as indicated in Fig. 7.51. According to Ohm’s law, then, Vn<h V(a, <(>) = ——, (-JT < <p < +jt). (a) Use separation of variables in cylindrical coordinates to determine V(s,4>) inside and outside the cylinder.

[Answer: (eo'/o/;ra )t an(0/2)] Problem 7.42 In a perfect conductor, the conductivity is infinite, so E = 0 (Eq. 7.3), and any net charge resides on the surface (just as it does for an imperfect conductor, in electrostatics). (a) Show that the magnetic field is constant (3B/3 1 = 0), inside a perfect conductor. (b) Show that the magnetic flux through a perfectly conducting loop is constant. 7.3. MAXWELL’S EQUATIONS 337 Problem 7.49 An atomic electron (charge q) circles about the nucleus (charge Q) in an orbit of radius r; the centripetal acceleration is provided, of course, by the Coulomb attraction of opposite charges Now a small magnetic field dB is slowly turned on, perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. Show that the increase in kinetic energy, dT, imparted by the induced electric field, is just right to sustain circular motion at the same radius r. (That’s why, in my discussion of diamagnetism, I assumed the radius is fixed. See Sect. 6.1.3 and the references cited there.) Problem 7.50 The current in a long solenoid is increasing linearly with time, so that the flux is proportional to t: <t> = at. Two voltmeters are connected to diametrically opposite points (A and B), together with resistors (/?! and R2). as shown in Fig. 7.53. What is the reading on each voltmeter? Assume that these are ideal voltmeters that draw negligible current (they have huge internal resistance), and that a voltmeter registers E • d\\ between the terminals and through the meter. [Answer: V\\ = aRl/ (R] + R2): V2 = -aR 2/(R ] + R2). Notice that Vj A V2, even though they are connected to the same points! See R. H. Romer, Am. J Phys. 50, 1089 (1982).] Problem 7.51 In the discussion of motional emf (Sect. 7.1.3) I assumed that the wire loop (Fig. 7.10) has a resistance R\\ the current generated is then I = vBh/R. But what if the wire is made out of perfectly conducting material, so that R is zero? In that case the current is limited only by the back emf associated with the self-inductance L of the loop (which would ordinarily be negligible in comparison with IR). Show that in this regime the loop (mass m) executes simple harmonic motion, and find its frequency.20 [Answer: co = Bh/QmL] Problem 7.52 (a) Use the Neumann formula (Eq. 7.22) to calculate the mutual inductance of the configuration in Fig. 7.36, assuming a is very small (a <K b, a <K z).

ELECTRODYNAMICS where ab ^ z2 + a2 +b 2 Problem 7.53 Two coils are wrapped around a cylindrical form in such a way that the same flux passes through every turn of both coils. (In practice this is achieved by inserting an iron core through the cylinder; this has the effect of concentrating the flux.) The “primary” coil has Ni turns and the secondary has N2 (Fig. 7.54). If the current I in the primary is changing, show that the emf in the secondary is given by S2 _ Nj 8~1 ~ Ni' (7.67) where S\\ is the (back) emf of the primary. [This is a primitive transformer—a device for raising or lowering the emf of an alternating current source. By choosing the appropriate number of turns, any desired secondary emf can be obtained. If you think this violates the conservation of energy, check out Prob. 7.54.] Problem 7.54 A transformer (Prob. 7.53) takes an input AC voltage of amplitude V\\, and delivers an output voltage of amplitude V2, which is determined by the turns ratio (V2/V\\ = N2/N 1). If N2 > N1 the output voltage is greater than the input voltage. Why doesn’t this violate conservation of energy? Answer: Power is the product of voltage and current; evidently if the voltage goes up, the current must come down. The purpose of this problem is to see exactly how this works out, in a simplified modpl. (a) In an ideal transformer the same flux passes through all turns of the primary and of the secondary. Show that in this case M2 = 1.1 /.2- where M is the mutual inductance of the coils, and L\\, L2 are their individual self-inductances.

(d) Show that the output voltage (Vout = l2P ) divided by the input voltage (V ln) is equal to the turns ratio: V0ut/V ia = N 2/N 1. (e) Calculate the input power (P in = P in7i) and the output power (P out = VoUt7 2), and show that their averages over a full cycle are equal. Problem 7.55 Suppose J(r) is constant in time butpfr. t) is not—conditions that might prevail, for instance, during the charging of a capacitor. (a) S how that the charge density at any particular point is a linear function of time: p(r, t) = p(r, 0) + p(r, 0)f, where p(r, 0) is the time derivative of p at t = 0. This is not an electrostatic or magnetostatic configuration;21 nevertheless—rather surprisingly_ both Coulomb’s law (in the form of Eq. 2.8) and the Biot-Savart law (Eq. 5.39) hold, as you can confirm by showing that they satisfy Maxwell’s equations. In particular: (b) S how that B(r) Mo f J(r') x i 4 7T / dr' obeys Ampere’s law with Maxwell’s displacement current term. Problem 7.56 The magnetic field of an infinite straight wire carrying a steady current I can be obtained from the displacement current term in the Ampere/Maxwell law, as follows: Picture the current as consisting of a uniform line charge k moving along the z axis at speed v (so that I = kv), with a tiny gap of length e, which reaches the origin at time t = 0. In the next instant (up to t = e/v) there is no real current passing through a circular Amperian loop in the xy plane, but there is a displacement current, due to the “missing” charge in the gap. (a) Use Coulomb’s law to calculate the z component of the electric field, for points in the xy plane a distance s from the origin, due to a segment of wire with uniform density —k extending from z 1 = vt — e to z.2 = vt. (b) Determine the flux of this electric field through a circle of radius a in the xy plane. (c) Find the displacement current through this circle. Show that I d is equal to 7, in the limit as the gap width (e) goes to zero. [For a slightly different approach to the same problem, see W. K. Terry, Am. J. Phys. 50, 742 (1982).] Problem 7.57 The magnetic field outside a long straight wire carrying a steady current 7 is (of course) B = — £ , 2 n s 21 Some authors would regard this as magnetostatic, since B is independent off. For them, the Biot-Savart law is a general mle of magnetostatics, but V - J = 0 and V x B — MoJ apply only under the additional assumption that p is constant. In such a formulation Maxwell’s displacement term can (in this very special case) be derived from the Biot-Savart law, by the method of part (b). See D. F. Bartlett, Am. J. Phys. 58, 1168 (1990); D. J. Griffiths and M. A. Fleald, Am. J. Phys. 59, 111 (1991). 340 CHAPTER 7. ELECTRODYNAMICS Figure 7.55 The electric field inside the wire is uniform: where p is the resistivity and a is the radius (see Exs. 7.1 and 7.3). Question: What is the electric field outside the wire? This is a famous problem, first analyzed by Sommerfeld, and known in its most recent incarnation as “Merzbacher’s puzzle.”22 The answer depends on how you complete the circuit. Suppose the current returns along a perfectly conducting grounded coaxial cylinder of radius b (Fig. 7.55). In the region a < s < b, the potential V(s,z) satisfies Laplace’s equation, with the boundary conditions (i) V{a,z) = -~\\ (ii) V(b,z) = 0. 7Tflz Unfortunately, this does not suffice to determine the answer—we still need to specify boundary conditions at the two ends. In the literature it is customary to sweep this ambiguity under the rug by simply asserting (in so many words) that V(s,z) is proportional to z: V(s, z) = zf(s). On this assumption: (a) Determine V(s,z). (b) Find E(j, z). (c) Calculate the surface charge density o(z) on the wire. [Answer: V = (—I zp/tta 2)[\\n(s/b)/\\n(a/b)] This is a peculiar result, since E s andcr(z) are not independent of z—as one would certainly expect for a truly infinite wire.] Problem 7.58 A certain transmission line is constructed from two thin metal “ribbons,” of width w, a very small distance h <K w apart. The current travels down one strip and back along the other. In each case it spreads out uniformly over the surface of the ribbon. (a) Find the capacitance per unit length, C. (b) Find the inductance per unit length, C. (c) What is the product CC, numerically? [C and C will, of course, vary from one kind of transmission line to another, but their product is a universal constant—check, for example, the cable in Ex. 7.13—provided the space between the conductors is a vacuum. In the theory of transmission lines, this product is related to the speed with which a pulse propagates down the line: v = l/«/££.\\ 22 A.

[This means, in particular, that if you know the fields produced by a configuration of electric charge, you can immediately (using a = 90°) write down the fields produced by the corresponding arrangement of magnetic charge.] (b) Show that the force law (Prob. 7.35) F = qe( YL + v x B) + qm( B — v x E) (7.69) is also invariant under the duality transformation. Intermission All of our cards are now on the table, and in a sense my job is done. In the first seven chapters we assembled electrodynamics piece by piece, and now, with Maxwell’s equations in their final form, the theory is complete. There are no more laws to be learned, no further generalizations to be considered, and (with perhaps one exception) no lurking inconsistencies to be resolved. If yours is a one-semester course, this would be a reasonable place to stop. But in another sense we have just arrived at the starting point. We are at last in possession of a full deck, and we know the rules of the game—it’s time to deal. This is the fun part, in which one comes to appreciate the extraordinary power and richness of electrodynamics. In a full-year course there should be plenty of time to cover the remaining chapters, and perhaps to supplement them with a unit on plasma physics, say, or AC circuit theory, or even a little General Relativity. But if you have room only for one topic, I’d recommend Chapter 9, on Electromagnetic Waves (you’ll probably want to skim Chapter 8 as preparation). This is the segue to Optics, and is historically the most important application of Maxwell’s theory. Chapter 8 Conservation Laws 8.1 Charge and Energy 8.1.1 The Continuity Equation In this chapter we study conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum, in electrodynamics. But I want to begin by reviewing the conservation of charge, because it is the paradigm for all conservation laws. What precisely does conservation of charge tell us? That the total charge ip the universe is constant? Well, sure—that’s global conservation of charge; but local conservation of charge is a much stronger statement: If the total charge in some volume changes, then exactly that amount of charge must have passed in or out through the surface. The tiger can’t simply rematerialize outside the cage; if it got from inside to outside it must have found a hole in the fence.

(8.4) 346 CHAPTER 8. CONSERVATION LAWS This is, of course, the continuity equation—the precise mathematical statement of local conservation of charge. As I indicated earlier, it can be derived from Maxwell’s equations— conservation of charge is not an independent assumption, but a consequence of the laws of electrodynamics. The purpose of this chapter is to construct the corresponding equations for conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. In the process (and perhaps more important) we will learn how to express the energy density and the momentum density (the analogs to p ). as well as the energy “current” and the momentum “current” (analogous to J). 8.1.2 Poynting’s Theorem In Chapter 2, we found that the work necessary to assemble a static charge distribution (against the Coulomb repulsion of like charges) is (Eq. 2.45) We = y j E 2d r, where E is the resulting electric field. Likewise, the work required to get currents going (against the back emf) is (Eq. 7.34) Wm = - ]- [ B2d x, 2/xo J where B is the resulting magnetic field. This suggests that the total energy stored in elec¬ tromagnetic fields is t/em = \\ J (toE 2 + ~B 2^ dr. (8.51 I propose to derive Eq. 8.5 more generally, now, in the context of the energy conservation law for electrodynamics. Suppose we have some charge and current configuration which, at time t, produces fields E arid B. In the next instant, dt, the charges move around a bit. Question: How much work, dW, is done by the electromagnetic forces acting on these charges in the interval clt According to the Lorentz force law, the work done on a charge q is F • dl = q{E + \\ xE) -\\dt — qE-\\dt. Now, q = pdz and pv = J, so the rate at which work is done on all the charges in a volume V is dw r -= / (E-J)dx. (8.6) dt Jy Evidently E • J is the work done per unit time, per unit volume—which is to say, the power delivered per unit volume. We can express this quantity in terms of the fields alone, using the Ampere-Maxwell law to eliminate J: 1 3E E • J = —E • (V x B) — eoE • — . HO dt 8.1. CHARGE AND ENERGY 347 From product rule 6, V • (E x B) = B • (V x E) - E • (V x B). Invoking Faraday’s law (V x E = -3B/3f), it follows that Meanwhile, so on E • (V x B) = —B-V • (E x B). dt „ 3B 1 3 2 3E 3 7 B-=- ( B 2), and E-= - — (E 2), 31 23 1 31 23 1 ’ E   J = (e 0E 2 + — B2) - — V • (E x B). 2 dt V MO / MO (8.7) (8.8) Putting this into Eq. 8.6, and applying the divergence theorem to the second term, we have dW dt 1 + —B 2 MO p (E x B) • da, s (8.9) where <S is the surface bounding V. This is Poynting’s theorem; it is the “work-energy theorem” of electrodynamics. The first integral on the right is the total energy stored in the fields, Ucm (Eq. 8.5). The second term evidently represents the rate at which energy is carried out of V, across its boundary surface, by the electromagnetic fields. Poynting’s theorem says, then, that the work done on the charges by the electromagnetic force is equal to the decrease in energy stored in the field, less the energy that flowed out through the surface. The energy per unit time, per unit area, transported by the fields is called the Poynting vector: S 1 MO (E x B). (8.10 ) Specifically, S • da is the energy per unit time crossing the infinitesimal surface da—the energy flux, if you like (so S is the energy flux density).1 We will see many applications of the Poynting vector in Chapters 9 and 11, but for the moment I am mainly interested in using it to express Poynting’s theorem more compactly: dW dt dU em dt S   da. (8.11) 'if you’re very fastidious, you’ll notice a small gap in the logic here: We know from Eq. 8.9 that <fS-da is the total power passing through a closed surface, but this does not prove that / S   da is the power passing through any open surface (there could be an extra term that integrates to zero over all closed surfaces). This is, however, the obvious and natural interpretation; as always, the precise location of energy is not really determined in electrodynamics (see Sect. 2.4.4). 348 CHAPTER 8. CONSERVATION LAWS Of course, the work W done on the charges will increase their mechanical energy (kinetic, potential, or whatever). If we let «/mcch denote the mechanical energy density, so that dW d f — ~T~ I Mmech dz, (8.12) dt dt Jy and use uem for the energy density of the fields, uem = Ue 0E 2 + — B 2Y 2 V MO / (8.13) then and hence d dt J f (wmech ~\\~ wem) dt — — S ' dfi — — V Js f (V-S)dr, Jv a mech wem) = V • S. dt (8.14) This is the differential version of Poynting’s theorem. Compare it with the continuity equation, expressing conservation of charge (Eq. 8.4): the charge density is replaced by the energy density (mechanical plus electromagnetic), and the current density is replaced by the Poynting vector. The latter represents the flow of energy in exactly the same way that J describes the flow of charge? Example 8.1 When current flows down a wire, work is done, which shows up as Joule heating of the wire (Eq. 7.7). Though there are certainly easier ways to do it, the energy per unit time delivered to the wire can be calculated using the Poynting vector. Assuming it’s uniform, the electric field parallel to the wire is E V L ’ where V is the potential difference between the ends and L is the length of the wire (Fig. 8.1). The magnetic field is “circumferential”; at the surface (radius a) it has the value MO I 2na Accordingly, the magnitude of the Poynting vector is 5 = _J_Pmo/ = VI HO L 2na 2naL ’ 2In the presence of linear media, one is typically interested only in the work done on free charges and currents (see Sect. 4.4.3). In that case the appropriate energy density is | (E   D + B • H), and the Poynting vector becomes (E x H). See J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd. ed., Sect. 6.7 (New York: John Wiley, 1999). 8.2. MOMENTUM 349 Figure 8.1 and it points radially inward. The energy per unit time passing in through the surface of the wire is therefore / S   da = S(2naL) = VI, which is exactly what we concluded, on much more direct grounds, in Sect. 7.1.1. Problem 8.1 Calculate the power (energy per unit time) transported down the cables of Ex. 7.13 andProb. 7.58, assuming the two conductors are held at potential difference V, and carry current I (down one and back up the other). Problem 8.2 Consider the charging capacitor in Prob. 7.31. (a) Find the electric and magnetic fields in the gap, as functions of the distance s from the axis and the time t. (Assume the charge is zero at t = 0.) (b) Find the energy density ucm and the Poynting vector S in the gap. Note especially the direction of S. Check that Eq. 8.14 is satisfied. (c) Determine the total energy in the gap, as a function of time. Calculate the total power flowing into the gap, by integrating the Poynting vector over the appropriate surface. Check that the power input is equal to the rate of increase of energy in the gap (Eq. 8.9—in this case w = 0, because there is no charge in the gap). [If you’re worried about the fringing fields, do it for a volume of radius b < a well inside the gap.] 8.2 Momentum 8.2.1 Newton’s Third Law in Electrodynamics Imagine a point charge q traveling in along the x axis at a constant speed v. Because it is moving, its electric field is not given by Coulomb’s law; nevertheless, E still points radially outward from the instantaneous position of the charge (Fig. 8.2a), as we’ll see in Chapter 10. Since, moreover, a moving point charge does not constitute a steady current, its magnetic 350 CHAPTER 8. CONSERVATION LAWS (a) (b) Figure 8.2 field is not given by the Biot-Savart law. Nevertheless, it’s a fact that B still circles around the axis in a manner suggested by the right-hand rule (Fig. 8.2b); again, the proof will come in Chapter 10. Now suppose this charge encounters an identical one, proceeding in at the same speed along the y axis. Of course, the electromagnetic force between them would tend to drive them off the axes, but let’s assume that they’re mounted on tracks, or something, so they’re forced to maintain the same direction and the same speed (Fig. 8.3). The electric force between them is repulsive, but how about the magnetic force? Well, the magnetic field of q\\ points into the page (at the position of q2), so the magnetic force on q2 is toward the right, whereas the magnetic field of q2 is out of the page (at the position of q\\), and the magnetic force on q\\ is upward. The electromagnetic force of q\\ on q2 is equal but not opposite to the force of q2 on q\\, in violation of Newton’s third law. In electro statics and magnetostatics the third law holds, but in electrodynamics it does not. Figure 8.3 8.2. MOMENTUM 351 Well, that’s an interesting curiosity, but then, how often does one actually use the third law, in practice? Answer: All the time! For the proof of conservation of momentum rests on the cancellation of internal forces, which follows from the third law. When you tamper with the third law, you are placing conservation of momentum in jeopardy, and there is no principle in physics more sacred than that. Momentum conservation is rescued in electrodynamics by the realization that the fields themselves carry momentum. This is not so surprising when you consider that we have already attributed energy to the fields. In the case of the two point charges in Fig. 8.3, whatever momentum is lost to the particles is gained by the fields. Only when the field momentum is added to the mechanical momentum of the charges is momentum conservation restored. You’ll see how this works out quantitatively in the following sections. 8.2.2 Maxwell’s Stress Tensor Let’s calculate the total electromagnetic force on the charges in volume V: F —I (E + vxB)pdr= j (pE + J x B) rfr. Jv Jv Tht force per unit volume is evidently f = pE + J x B. (8.15) (8.16) As before, I propose to write this in terms of fields alone, eliminating p and J by using Maxwell’s equations (i) and (iv): (1 3E \\ — V x B — eo— ) x B.

MO dt (8.17) 352 CHAPTER 8. CONSERVATION LAWS Just to make things look more symmetrical, let’s throw in a term (V • B)B; since V • B = 0, this costs us nothing. Meanwhile, product rule 4 says V(E Z) =2(E- V)E + 2Ex (V x E), SO E x (V x E) = i V(£2) - (E • V)E, and the same goes for B. Therefore, f = e0[(V • E)E + (E • V)E] + — [(V • B)B + (B • V)B] Mo (8.18) V fe0E 2 + — B2) - €0~ ( E x B). 2 V TO J dt Ugly! But it can be simplified by introducing the Maxwell stress tensor, Tij = €0 (e,E, - ^SijE 2^ + ^R,Rj - ^SijB 2\\ . (8.19) The indices i and j refer to the coordinates x, y, and z, so the stress tensor has a total of nine components (T xx. Tyy. Txz, Tyx, and so on). The Kronecker delta, 5(/-, is 1 if the indices are the same (Sxx = 8yy = 8ZZ = 1) and zero otherwise (8xy = 8XZ = 8yz = 0). Thus Txx = \\eo(E 2x - E2 - El) + ^-{B 2 - R; - B2), Txy= €0(E xE y) + —(B XB y), TO and so on. Because it carries two indices, where a vector has only one, Tjj is sometimes written with a double arrow: ¥. One can form the dot product of \"IT with a vector a: (»•¥),/ = I] aiT U> (8.20) i=x,y,z the resulting object, which has one remaining index, is itself a vector. In particular, the divergence of ¥ has as its yth component V • E)Ej + (E   V)Ej - (V-B)By + (B.V)By-iv yB 2 . Thus the force per unit volume (Eq. 8.18) can be written in the much simpler form * = v • T - 60M0-7-, dt where S is the Poynting vector (Eq. 8.10). (V-¥)y = 60 1 _|_ - M 0 (8.21) 8.2.

In the static case (or, more generally, whenever f Sdr is independent of time), the second term drops out, and the electromagnetic force on the charge configuration can be expressed entirely in terms of the stress tensor at the boundary. Physically, \"IT is the force per unit area (or stress) acting on the surface. More precisely, 7)j is the force (per unit area) in the ith direction acting on an element of surface oriented in the yth direction—“diagonal” elements (Txx, Tyy, 7’--) represent/) revs u res, and “off-diagonal” elements (T xy, Txz, etc.) axe shears. Example 8.2 Determine the net force on the “northern” hemisphere of a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and charge Q (the same as Prob. 2.43, only this time we’ll use the Maxwell stress tensor and Eq. 8.22). Figure 8.4 Solution: The boundary surface consists of two parts—a hemispherical “bowl” at radius R, and a circular disk at 9 = jt/2 (Fig. 8.4).

Q2 4jt60 8R2 ’ 8.2. MOMENTUM 355 I hope you didn’t get too bogged down in the details of Ex. 8.2. If so, take a moment to appreciate what happened. We were calculating the force on a solid object, but instead of doing a volume integral, as you might expect, Eq. 8.22 allowed us to set it up as a surface integral; somehow the stress tensor sniffs out what is going on inside. Problem 8.3 Calculate the force of magnetic attraction between the northern and southern hemispheres of a uniformly charged spinning spherical shell, with radius R, angular velocity co, and surface charge density o. [This is the same as Prob. 5.42, but this time use the Maxwell stress tensor and Eq. 8.22.] Problem 8.4 (a) Consider two equal point charges q, separated by a distance 2a. Construct the plane equidistant from the two charges. By integrating Maxwell’s stress tensor over this plane, determine the force of one charge on the other. (b) Do the same for charges that are opposite in sign. 8.2.3 Conservation of Momentum According to Newton’s second law, the force on an object is equal to the rate of change of its momentum: p _ Pmedl dt Equation 8.22 can therefore be written in the form Pmech dt -€0T0 dt (8.28) where pmech is the total (mechanical) momentum of the particles contained in the volume V. This expression is similar in structure to Poynting’s theorem (Eq. 8.9), and it invites an anal¬ ogous interpretation: The first integral represents momentum stored in the electromagnetic fields themselves: Pem = /xoe0 / Sdr, (8.29) JV while the second integral is the momentum per unit time flowing in through the surface. Equation 8.28 is the general statement of conservation of momentum in electrodynamics: Any increase in the total momentum (mechanical plus electromagnetic) is equal to the momentum brought in by the fields. (If V is all of space, then no momentum flows in or out, and Pmech T Pem i - constant.) As in the case of conservation of charge and conservation of energy, conservation of momentum can be given a differential formulation. Let p mech be the density of mechanical momentum, and p em the density of momentum in the fields: IPem T O^oS. (8.30) 356 CHAPTER 8. CONSERVATION LAWS Then Eq. 8.28, in differential form, says (Pmech 5\" Pern) — V • (8.31) Evidently is the momentum flux density, playing the role of J (current density) in the continuity equation, or S (energy flux density) in Poynting’s theorem. Specifically, -7)y is the momentum in the i direction crossing a surface oriented in the j direction, per unit area, per unit time. Notice that the Poynting vector has appeared in two quite different roles: S itself is the energy per unit area, per unit time, transported by the electromagnetic fields, while /x0eoS is the momentum per unit volume stored in those fields. Similarly, plays a dual role: itself is the electromagnetic stress (force per unit area) acting on a surface, and — ¥ describes the flow of momentum (the momentum current density) transported by the fields. Example 8.3 A long coaxial cable, of length /, consists of an inner conductor (radius a) and an outer conductor (radius b). It is connected to a battery at one end and a resistor at the other (Fig. 8.5). The inner conductor carries a uniform charge per unit length X, and a steady current I to the right; the outer conductor has the opposite charge and current. What is the electromagnetic momentum stored in the fields? Solution: The fields are E = ^--s, b=*>L$. 2tt€() s 2n s The Poynting vector is therefore 4tt260,2 *  Evidently energy is flowing down the line, from the battery to the resistor.

But that’s not what we’re interested in right now. The momentum in the fields Pem — M0e0 / St/r = HqM - fb ZJ a —I2jtsds sl IIqXII 2 TT In(b/a) x. This is an astonishing result. The cable is not moving, and the fields are static, and yet we are asked to believe that there is momentum in the system. If something tells you this cannot be the whole story, you have sound intuitions. In fact, if the center of mass of a localized system is at rest, its total momentum must be zero. In this case it turns out that there is “hidden” mechanical momentum associated with the flow of current, and this exactly cancels the momentum in the fields. But locating the hidden momentum is not easy, and it is actually a relativistic effect, so I shall save it for Chapter 12 (Ex. 12.12). Suppose now that we turn up the resistance, so the current decreases. The changing magnetic field will induce an electric field (Eq. 7.19): E = 7r,() dl 2n dt In s + K z. This field exerts a force on ±A: F = XI an dl ^- — \\na + K x — XI Mo dl , , — — Inb + K 2.TT dt _2n dt MoXI dl 2it dt In (b/a) x. The total momentum imparted to the cable, as the current drops from 7 to 0, is therefore Pmech / / 2 TT In (b/a) z, which is precisely the momentum originally stored in the fields. (The cable will not recoil, however, because an equal and opposite impulse is delivered by the simultaneous disappearance of the hidden momentum.) Problem 8.5 Consider an infinite parallel-plate capacitor, with the lower plate (at z = —d/2) carrying the charge density —a, and the upper plate (at z = +d/2) carrying the charge density +o\\ (a) D etermine all nine elements of the stress tensor, in the region between the plates.

(d) At the plates this momentum is absorbed, and the plates recoil (unless there is some nonelectrical force holding them in position). Find the recoil force per unit area on the top 358 CHAPTER 8. CONSERVATION LAWS Figure 8.6 plate, and compare your answer to (b). [Note: This is not an additional force, but rather an alternative way of calculating the same force—in (b) we got it from the force law, and in (d) we did it by conservation of momentum.] Problem 8.6 A charged parallel-plate capacitor (with uniform electric field E = E z) is placed in a uniform magnetic field B = B x, as shown in Fig. 8.6.3 (a) Find the electromagnetic momentum in the space between the plates. (b) Now a resistive wire is connected between the plates, along the z axis, so that the capacitor slowly discharges. The current through the wire will experience a magnetic force; what is the total impulse delivered to the system, during the discharge? (c) Instead of turning off the electric field (as in (b)), suppose we slowly reduce the magnetic field. This will induce a Faraday electric field, which in turn exerts a force on the plates. Show that the total impulse is (again) equal to the momentum originally stored in the fields. 8.2.4 Angular Momentum By now the electromagnetic fields (which started out as mediators offerees between charges) have taken on a life of their own. They carry energy (Eq. 8.13) Rem 1 2 eoE2 and momentum (Eq. 8.30) Pem = /fefoS = e0(E X B), and, for that matter, angular momentum: (8.32) (8.33) 4m = rx p em = eo [r X (E X B)]. 3See F. S. Johnson, B. L. Cragin, and R. R. Hodges, Am. J. Phys. 62, 33 (1994). (8.34) 8.2. MOMENTUM 359 Even perfectly static fields can harbor momentum and angular momentum, as long as E x B is nonzero, and it is only when these field contributions are included that the classical conservation laws hold. Example 8.4 Imagine a very long solenoid with radius R, n turns per unit length, and current 7. Coaxial with the solenoid are two long cylindrical shells of length l—one, inside the solenoid at radius a, carries a charge +Q, uniformly distributed over its surface; the other, outside the solenoid at radius b, carries charge — Q (see Fig. 8.7; l is supposed to be much greater than b). When the current in the solenoid is gradually reduced, the cylinders begin to rotate, as we found in Ex. 7.8. Question: Where does the angular momentum come from?^ Solution: It was initially stored in the fields. Before the current was switched off, there was an electric field, Q 1 - E =-s (a < s < b). 2netyl s z Figure 8.7 4This is a variation on the “Feynman disk paradox” (R. P. Feynman, R. B. Leighton, and M. Sands, The Feynman Lectures, vol 2, pp. 17-5 (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1964) suggested by F. L. Boos, Jr. (Am. J. Phys. 52, 756 (1984)). A similar model was proposed earlier by R. H. Romer (Am. J. Phys. 34, 772 (1966)). For further references, see T.-C. E. Ma, Am. J. Phys. 54, 949 (1986). 360 CHAPTER 8.

So it all works out: Lem = Lu + L/>. The angular momentum lost by the fields is precisely equal to the angular momentum gained by the cylinders, and the total angular momentum (fields plus matter) is conserved. 8.2. MOMENTUM 361 Incidentally, the angular case is in some respects cleaner than the linear analog (Ex. 8.3), because there is no “hidden” angular momentum to compensate for the angular momentum in the fields, and the cylinders really do rotate when the magnetic field is turned off. If a localized system is not moving, its total linear momentum has to be zero,5 but there is no corresponding theorem for angular momentum, and in Prob. 8.12 you will see a beautiful example in which nothing at all is moving—not even currents—and yet the angular momentum is nonzero. Problem 8.7 In Ex. 8.4, suppose that instead of turning off the magnetic field (by reducing I) we turn off the electric field, by connecting a weakly6 conducting radial spoke between the cylinders. (We’ll have to cut a slot in the solenoid, so the cylinders can still rotate freely.) From the magnetic force on the current in the spoke, determine the total angular momentum delivered to the cylinders, as they discharge (they are now rigidly connected, so they rotate together). Compare the initial angular momentum stored in the fields (Eq. 8.35). (Notice that the mechanism by which angular momentum is transferred from the fields to the cylinders is entirely different in the two cases: in Ex. 8.4 it was Faraday’s law, but here it is the Lorentz force law.) Problem 8.87 8 Imagine an iron sphere of radius R that carries a charge Q and a uniform magnetization M = Mi. The sphere is initially at rest. (a) Compute the angular momentum stored in the electromagnetic fields. (b) Suppose the sphere is gradually (and uniformly) demagnetized (perhaps by heating it up past the Curie point). Use Faraday’s law to determine the induced electric field, find the torque this field exerts on the sphere, and calculate the total angular momentum imparted to the sphere in the course of the demagnetization. (c) Suppose instead of demagnetizing the sphere we discharge It, by connecting a grounding wire to the north pole. Assume the current flows over the surface in such a way that the charge density remains uniform. Use the Lorentz force law to determine the torque on the sphere, and calculate the total angular momentum imparted to the sphere in the course of the discharge.

[Answer: (iJ,o/4n)qeq m.]]2 Problem 8.13 Paul DeYoung, of Hope College, points out that because the cylinders in Ex. 8.4 are left rotating (at angular velocities ioa and cog, say), there is actually a residual magnetic field, and hence angular momentum in the fields, even after the current in the solenoid has been extinguished. If the cylinders are heavy, this correction will be negligible, but it is interesting to do the problem without making that assumption. 9For an interesting discussion and references, see R. H.

Refer to Sect. 4.4.3 for the meaning of “energy” in this context. Chapter 9 Electromagnetic Waves 9.1 Waves in One Dimension 9.1.1 The Wave Equation What is a “wave?” I don’t think I can give you an entirely satisfactory answer—the concept is intrinsically somewhat vague—but here’s a start: A wave is a disturbance of a continuous medium that propagates with a fixed shape at constant velocity. Immediately I must add qualifiers: In the presence of absorption, the wave will diminish in size as it moves; if the medium is dispersive different frequencies travel at different speeds; in two or three dimensions, as the wave spreads out its amplitude will decrease; and of course standing waves don’t propagate at all. But these are refinements; let’s start with the simple case: fixed shape, constant speed (Fig. 9.1). How would you represent such an object mathematically? In the figure I have drawn the wave at two different times, once at t = 0, and again at some later time t—each point on the wave form simply shifts to the right by an amount vt, where v is the velocity. Maybe the wave is generated by shaking one end of a taut string; f(z,t) represents the displacement of the string at the point z, at time t. Given the initial shape of the string, g(z) = f(z, 0), Figure 9.1 364 9.1. WAVES IN ONE DIMENSION 365 what is the subsequent form, f(z, t)? Evidently, the displacement at point z, at the later time t, is the same as the displacement a distance vt to the left (i.e. at z — vt), back at time t= 0: f(z,t) = f(z-vt,0) = g(z-vt). (9.1) That statement captures (mathematically) the essence of wave motion. It tells us that the function f(z,t), which might have depended on z and t in any old way, in fact depends on them only in the very special combination z - vt; when that is true, the function f(z, t) represents a wave of fixed shape traveling in the z direction at speed v. For example, if A and b are constants (with the appropriate units), fi(z, t) = Ae b(-z vt) , f 2{z,t) = Asin[b{z - vt)], fe{z,t) all represent waves (with different shapes, of course), but b(z - vt)2 + 1 fn{z, t) = Ae b(bz +vt\\ and fs(z, t) = A sin(bz) cos(bvt)3, do not. Why does a stretched string support wave motion? Actually, it follows from Newton’s second law. Imagine a very long string under tension T. If it is displaced from equilibrium, the net transverse force on the segment between z and z + Az (Fig. 9.2) is AF = TsinO' - T sin6, where O’ is the angle the string makes with the z-direction at point z + Az, and 6 is the corresponding angle at point z. Provided that the distortion of the string is not too great, these angles are small (the figure is exaggerated, obviously), and we can replace the sine by the tangent: AF = THa.nO' - land) = T 3/ 9z z+Az 3/ dz A z. Figure 9.2 366 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES If the mass per unit length is n, Newton’s second law says 9 2f and therefore 9V = dz2 T dt2 ' Evidently, small disturbances on the string satisfy 9V j_aV dz2 v2 dt2 ’ where v (which, as we’ll soon see, represents the speed of propagation) is (9.2) u = (9.3) V p Equation 9.2 is known as the (classical) wave equation, because it admits as solutions all functions of the form f(z, t) = g(z - vt), (9.4) (that is, all functions that depend on the variables z and t in the special combination u = z — vt), and we have just learned that such functions represent waves propagating in the z direction with speed v. For Eq. 9.4 means 9/ dg du dg df dg du dg dz du dz du ’ dt du dt du ’ and d2/ _ _9_ / d g\\ _ (fg_du _ <Pg dz2 dz\\du) du2 dz du2’ d2/ _ _ vd _ (dg\\ _ _ v2d 2S dt2 dt \\du) du2 dt du2’ so d21= d ^l = \\ _d2l du2 dz2 v2 dt2 ^ Note that g (u ) can be any (differentiable) function whatever. If the disturbance propagates without changing its shape, then it satisfies the wave equation. But functions of the form g(z — vt) are not the only solutions. The wave equation involves the square of v, so we can generate another class of solutions by simply changing the sign of the velocity: f(z,t) = h(z + vt). (9.5) This, of course, represents a wave propagating in the negative z direction, and it is certainly reasonable (on physical grounds) that such solutions would be allowed. What is perhaps 9.1. WAVES IN ONE DIMENSION 367 surprising is that the most general solution to the wave equation is the sum of a wave to the right and a wave to the left: fiz, t) = g(z - vt) + h(z + vt). (9.6) (Notice that the wave equation is linear: The sum of any two solutions is itself a solution.) Every solution to the wave equation can be expressed in this form. Like the simple harmonic oscillator equation, the wave equation is ubiquitous in physics. If something is vibrating, the oscillator equation is almost certainly responsible (at least, for small amplitudes), and if something is waving (whether the context is mechanics or acoustics, optics or oceanography), the wave equation (perhaps with some decoration) is bound to be involved. Problem 9.1 By explicit differentiation, check that the functions fa, f 2, and fa in the text satisfy the wave equation. Show that fa and fa do not. Problem 9.2 Show that the standing wave f(z, t) = A sin(&z) cofakvt) satisfies the wave equation, and express it as the sum of a wave traveling to the left and a wave traveling to the right (Eq. 9.6). 9.1.2 Sinusoidal Waves (i) Terminology. Of all possible wave forms, the sinusoidal one f(z, t) = Acos[k(z - vt) + <5] (9.7) is (for good reason) the most familiar. Figure 9.3 shows this function at time t — 0. A is the amplitude of the wave (it is positive, and represents the maximum displacement from equilibrium). The argument of the cosine is called the phase, and <5 is the phase constant (obviously, you can add any integer multiple of 2n to <5 without changing f(z. t)\\o rdinarily, one uses a value in the range 0 < <5 < 2tt). Notice that at z — vt- S/k, the phase is zero; let’s call this the “central maximum.” If <5 = 0, the central maximum passes the origin at time t = 0; more generally, <5/k is the distance by which the central maximum (and Figure 9.3 368 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES therefore the entire wave) is “delayed.” Finally, k is the wave number; it is related to the wavelength A by the equation 2tt A = T’ (9-8) for when 2 advances by 2tt/k , the cosine executes one complete cycle. As time passes, the entire wave train proceeds to the right, at speed v. At any fixed point z, the string vibrates up and down, undergoing one full cycle in a period T ^ kv The frequency v (number of oscillations per unit time) is 1 kv v T 2tr A' (9.9) (9.10) For our purposes, a more convenient unit is the angular frequency to, so-called because in the analogous case of uniform circular motion it represents the number of radians swept out per unit time; to — 2jtv = kv. (9.11) Ordinarily, it’s nicer to write sinusoidal waves (Eq. 9.7) in terms of co, rather than v: f(z,t) = Acos(kz-cot + 8). (9.12) A sinusoidal oscillation of wave number k and (angular) frequency to traveling to the left would be written f(z,t) = A cos (kz+cot -8). (9.13) The sign of the phase constant is chosen for consistency with our previous convention that 8/k shall represent the distance by which the wave is “delayed” (since the wave is now moving to the left, a delay means a shift to the right). At t — 0. the wave looks like Fig. 9.4. Because the cosine is an even function, we can just as well write Eq. 9.13 thus: f(z,t) = Acos(-kz-cot + 8). (9.14) Comparison with Eq. 9.12 reveals that, in effect, we could simply switch the sign of k to produce a wave with the same amplitude, phase constant, frequency, and wavelength, traveling in the opposite direction. f(z, 0) Central Figure 9.4 9.1. WAVES IN ONE DIMENSION 369 (ii) Complex notation. In view of Euler’s formula, e,e = cosd + i sin$, (9.15) the sinusoidal wave (Eq. 9.12) can be written f(z, t) = Rt[Aei(kz- <ut+S)l (9.16) where Re(£) denotes the real part of the complex number §. This invites us to introduce the complex wave function f(z, t) = Aei{kz~wt), (9.17) with the complex amplitude A = Ae,s absorbing the phase constant. The actual wave function is the real part of /: f(z,t)=Rc[f(z,t)]. (9.18) If you know /, it is a simple matter to find /; the advantage of the complex notation is that exponentials are much easier to manipulate than sines and cosines. Example 9.1 Suppose you want to combine two sinusoidal waves: h = h+h= Re(/i) + Re(/2) = Re(/i + f 2) = Re(/ 3), with / 3 = /j + f 2. You simply add the corresponding complex wave functions, and then take the real part. In particular, if they have the same frequency and wave number, h = AYe i(kz~ M) + A2e i{kz- Wt'> = A2e i{kz- m), where A3 = Ax + A2, or A3e iSi = Aie iS< + A2e'h \\ (9.19) evidently, you just add the (complex) amplitudes. The combined wave still has the same frequency and wavelength, / 3( z, t) = A3 cos (kz. — cot + <53), and you can easily figure out A3 and <53 from Eq. 9.19 (Prob. 9.3). Try doing this without using the complex notation—you will find yourself looking up trig identities and slogging through nasty algebra. (iii) Linear combinations of sinusoidal waves. Although the sinusoidal function 9.17 is a very special wave form, the fact is that any wave can be expressed as a linear combination of sinusoidal ones: / oo A(k)ei(kz-° }t) dk. (9.20) -OO Here to is a function of k (Eq. 9.11), and I have allowed k to run through negative values in order to include waves going in both directions.1 1 This does not mean that X and oj are negative—wavelength and frequency are always positive. If we allow negative wave numbers, then Eqs. 9.8 and 9.11 should really be written X = 2ji/\\k\\ and co = |ft|u. 370 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES The formula for A(k), in terms of the initial conditions f(z„ 0) and f(z, 0), can be obtained from the theory of Fourier transforms (see Prob. 9.32), but the details are not relevant to my purpose here. The point is that any wave can be written as a linear combination of sinusoidal waves, and therefore if you know how sinusoidal waves behave, you know in principle how any wave behaves. So from now on we shall confine our attention to sinusoidal waves. Problem 9.3 Use Eq. 9.19 to determine A3 and S3 in terms of .4 ,. A2, Si, and S2. Problem 9.4 Obtain Eq. 9.20 directly from the wave equation, by separation of variables. 9.1.3 Boundary Conditions: Reflection and Transmission So far I have assumed the string is infinitely long—or at any rate long enough that we don’t need to worry about what happens to a wave when it reaches the end. As a matter of fact, what happens depends a lot on how the string is attached at the end—that is, on the specific boundary conditions to which the wave is subject. Suppose, for instance, that the string is simply tied onto a second string. The tension T is the same for both, but the mass per unit length p presumably is not, and hence the wave velocities n, and v2 are different (remember, v = V T/p ). Let’s say, for convenience, that the knot occurs at z = 0. The incident wave f,{z,t) = AIe iik^ t\\ (z < 0), (9.21) coming in from the left, gives rise to a reflected wave Ir(z, t) = ARe ,<'~klz~a,t\\ (z < 0), (9.22) traveling back along string 1 (hence the minus sign in front of k\\) , in addition to a trans¬ mitted wave friz, t) = Ar el{kll~wt), (z > 0), (9.23) which continues on to the right in string 2. The incident wave f/(z,t) is a sinusoidal oscillation that extends (in principle) all the way back to z = - 00 , and has been doing so for all of history. The same goes for f R and / r (except that the latter, of course, extends to - = + 00 ). All parts of the system are oscillating at the same frequency co (a frequency determined by the person at z = - 00 , who is shaking the string in the first place). Since the wave velocities are different in the two strings, however, the wavelengths and wave numbers are also different: _ k2 tq k2 k\\ v2 (9.24) Of course, this situation is pretty artificial—what’s more, with incident and reflected waves of infinite extent traveling on the same piece of string, it’s going to be hard for a spectator to 9.1. WAVES IN ONE DIMENSION 371 tell them apart. You might therefore prefer to consider an incident wave of finite extent— say, the pulse shown in Fig. 9.5. You can work out the details for yourself, if you like (Prob. 9.5). The trouble with this approach is that no finite pulse is truly sinusoidal. The waves in Fig. 9.5 may look like sine functions, but they’re not: they’re little pieces of sines, joined onto an entirely different function (namely, zero). Like any other waves, they can be built up as linear combinations of true sinusoidal functions (Eq. 9.20), but only by putting together a whole range of frequencies and wavelengths. If you want a single incident frequency (as we shall in the electromagnetic case), you must let your waves extend to infinity. In practice, if you use a very long pulse with many oscillations, it will be close to the ideal of a single frequency. (a) Incident pulse (b) Reflected and transmitted pulses Figure 9.5 For a sinusoidal incident wave, then, the net disturbance of the string is: ( XIe i{kn~ <3>t) + ARe‘^~k,z~ a>t\\ for z < 0, f(z, t) = J (9.25) At the join (z = 0), the displacement just slightly to the left (z = 0“) must equal the displacement slightly to the right (z = 0+), or else there would be a break between the two strings. Mathematically, /(z, t) is continuous at z = 0: /(0“,0 = f(0 +,t ). (9.26) If the knot itself is of negligible mass, then the derivative of / must also be continuous: 9/ = 8 f dz 0- dz 0+ (9.27) Otherwise there would be a net force on the knot, and therefore an infinite acceleration (Fig. 9.6). These boundary conditions apply directly to the real wave function /(z, t). But since the imaginary part of / differs from the real part only in the replacement of cosine by sine (Eq. 9.15), it follows that the complex wave function /(z, t) obeys the same rules: /(o-,„=/(oz», oz oz 0- lo+ 372 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES (a) Discontinuous slope; force on knot (a) Continuous slope; no force on knot Figure 9.6 When ^applied to Eq. 9.25, these boundary conditions determine the outgoing amplitudes (Ar and Ax) in terms of the incoming one (A/): A/ + Ar = Ax, ki(A[ — Ar) = k2Ax, from which it follows that 2 ki , ,k\\-k2 Ar — ( — -~r~ ) A/, Ax = Ax = M +k2 Or, in terms of the velocities (Eq. 9.24): , , V2~V i a R = I-:- I Ai, k\\ + k2 2v2 V2 + ni A/. A2 + Vi The real amplitudes and phases, then, are related by ARe iSR = (— ~ U1 ) A,eiSl, ATeiSr = ( 2vi Vto + fi/ \\tt2 + ni A,. ^ A,eih . (9.29) (9.30) (9.31) If the second string is lighter than the first (/r2 < /i i, so that i !2 > v \\), all three waves have the same phase angle (Sr = Sx = <5/), and the outgoing amplitudes are , , v2 - ni Ar — ( --- A/, Ax = V2 + Vl 2v2 V2 + (9.32) If the second string is heavier than the first (v2 < vi) the reflected wave is out of phase by 180° (Sr + n = Sx = 8]). In other words, since cos (—k\\z - tot + Si - n) = - cos (-k\\z - tot + Si), the reflected wave is “upside down.” The amplitudes in this case are ^1 ~ V2 V2 + tq A/ and Ax 1; + vj A/. (9.33) 9.1. WAVES IN ONE DIMENSION 373 In particular, if the second string is infinitely massive—or, what amounts to the same thing, if the first string is simply nailed down at the end—then Ar = Aj and At = 0. Naturally, in this case there is no transmitted wave—all of it reflects back. Problem 9.5 Suppose you send an incident wave of specified shape, gj(z — v\\t), down string number 1. It gives rise to a reflected wave, Iir (z + iq t), and a transmitted wave, gy (z — By imposing the boundary conditions 9.26 and 9.27, find h% and gj. Problem 9.6 (a) Formulate an appropriate boundary condition, to replace Eq. 9.27, for the case of two strings under tension T joined by a knot of mass m. (b) Find the amplitude and phase of the reflected and transmitted waves for the case where the knot has a mass m and the second string is massless. Problem 9.7 Suppose string 2 is embedded in a viscous medium (such as molasses), which imposes a drag force that is proportional to its (transverse) speed: 3/ = -y — Az.

That is, look for solutions of the form / (z, t) = eio}t F(z). (c) Show that the waves are attenuated (that is, their amplitude decreases with increasing z). Find the characteristic penetration distance, at which the amplitude is 1 /e of its original value, in terms of y, T, n, and a>. (d) If a wave of amplitude A j, phase Sj = 0, and frequency co is incident from the left (string 1) , find the reflected wave’s amplitude and phase. 9.1.4 Polarization The waves that travel down a string when you shake it are called transverse, because the displacement is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. If the string is reasonably elastic, it is also possible to stimulate compression waves, by giving the string little tugs. Compression waves are hard to see on a string, but if you try it with a slinky they’re quite noticeable (Fig. 9.7). These waves are called longitudinal, because the displacement from equilibrium is along the direction of propagation. Sound waves, which are nothing but compression waves in air, are longitudinal; electromagnetic waves, as we shall see, are transverse. 374 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES V Figure 9.7 Now there are, of course, two dimensions perpendicular to any given line of propagation. Accordingly, transverse waves occur in two independent states of polarization: you can shake the string up-and-down (“vertical” polarization—Fig. 9.8a), f„(z, t) = Aei(kz~ cot) x, (9.34) or left-and-right (“horizontal” polarization—Fig. 9.8b), fh(z,t) = Aei(kz~wt)y , (9.35) or along any other direction in the xy plane (Fig. 9.8c): f(z, t) = Aei(kz~ Mt) h. (9.36) The polarization vector n defines the plane of vibration.2 Because the waves are transverse, n is perpendicular to the direction of propagation: n • z = 0. (9.37) In terms of the polarization angle 9, n = cos9 x + sin# y. (9.38) Thus, the wave pictured in Fig. 9.8c can be considered a superposition of two waves—one horizontally polarized, the other vertically: f(z, 0 = (Acos9)el<'kz~0}‘) x + (Asin9)e,(kz~ a>t^ y. (9.39) Problem 9.8 Equation 9.36 describes the most general linearly polarized wave on a string. Linear (or “plane”) polarization (so called because the displacement is parallel to a fixed vector n) results from the combination of horizontally and vertically polarized waves of the same phase (Eq. 9.39). If the two components are of equal amplitude, but out of phase by 90° (say, &v =0, &h = 90°), the result is a circularly polarized wave. In that case: (a) At a fixed point z, show that the string moves in a circle about the z axis. Does it go clockwise or counterclockwise, as you look down the axis toward the origin? How would you construct a wave circling the other way? (In optics, the clockwise case is called right circular polarization, and the counterclockwise, left circular polarization.) (b) Sketch the string at time t = 0. (c) How would you shake the string in order to produce a circularly polarized wave? 2Notice that you can always switch the sign of n, provided you simultaneously advance the phase constant by 180°, since both operations change the sign of the wave. 9.2. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN VACUUM 375 (c) Polarization vector Figure 9.8 9.2 Electromagnetic Waves in Vacuum 9.2.1 The Wave Equation for E and B In regions of space where there is no charge or current, Maxwell’s equations read 9B (i) VE = 0, (iii) VxE =-, 9f (ii) V • B = 0, (iv) V x B = /r0eo —• J They constitute a set of coupled, first-order, partial differential equations for E and B.

ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES Or, since V • E = 0 and V • B = 0, V E = /rofo 92E W’ 2x> 9 B VB = ^o-^. (9.41) We now have separate equations for E and B, but they are of second order; that’s the price you pay for decoupling them. In vacuum, then, each Cartesian component of E and B satisfies the three-dimensional wave equation, V2f = ^X v2 dt2 (This is the same as Eq. 9.2, except that 92/ /9z2 is replaced by its natural generaliza¬ tion, V2 */ .) So Maxwell’s equations imply that empty space supports the propagation of electromagnetic waves, traveling at a speed v = = 3.00 x 108 m/s, (9.42) Veo/To which happens to be precisely the velocity of light, c. The implication is astounding: Perhaps light is an electromagnetic wave.3 Of course, this conclusion does not surprise anyone today, but imagine what a revelation it was in Maxwell’s time! Remember how f(l and po came into the theory in the first place: they were constants in Coulomb’s law and the Biot-Savart law, respectively. You measure them in experiments involving charged pith balls, batteries, and wires—experiments having nothing whatever to do with light. And yet, according to Maxwell’s theory you can calculate c from these two numbers. Notice the crucial role played by Maxwell’s contribution to Ampere’s law (p0e0dE/dt); without it, the wave equation would not emerge, and there would be no electromagnetic theory of light. 9.2.2 Monochromatic Plane Waves For reasons discussed in Sect. 9.1.2, we may confine our attention to sinusoidal waves of frequency a>. Since different frequencies in the visible range correspond to different colors, such waves are called monochromatic (Table 9.1). Suppose, moreover, that the waves are traveling in the z direction and have no x or y dependence; these are called plane waves,4 * because the fields are uniform over every plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation (Fig. 9.9). We are interested, then, in fields of the form E(z, t) = Eoel(kz~wt), B(z, t) = B0e‘(*z~a\"), (9.43) 3 As Maxwell himself put it, “We can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.” See Ivan Tolstoy, James Clerk Maxwell, A Biography (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983). 4For a discussion of spherical waves, at this level, see J. R. Reitz, F. J. Milford, and R. W. Christy, Foundations of Electromagnetic Theory, 3rd ed., Sect. 17-5 (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1979). Or work Prob. 9.33. Of course, over small enough regions any wave is essentially plane, as long as the wavelength is much less than the radius of the curvature of the wave front. 9.2.

Now, the wave equations for E and B (Eq. 9.41) were derived from Maxwell’s equations. However, whereas every solution to Maxwell’s equations (in empty space) must obey the wave equation, the converse is not true; Maxwell’s equations impose extra constraints on 378 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES Eo and Bo. In particular, since V • E = 0 and V • B = 0, it follows5 that (Eq)z = (B0)z = 0. (9.44) That is, electromagnetic waves are transverse: the electric and magnetic fields are per¬ pendicular to the direction of propagation. Moreover, Faraday’s law, V x E = —9B/dt. implies a relation between the electric and magnetic amplitudes, to wit: or, more compactly: -k(Eo)y — a>(Bo)x, k(Eo)x = co(Bo)y B0 = -(z x E 0). co Evidently, E and B are in phase and mutually perpendicular; their (real) amplitudes are related by „ k 1 B0 = -E 0 = -E 0. (9.47) CO c The fourth of Maxwell’s equations, VxB = /roeo(3E/9f), does not yield an independent condition; it simply reproduces Eq. 9.45. Example 9.2 If E points in the x direction, then B points in the y direction (Eq. 9.46): E(z, t) = Eoe,(fe“\" 0x, B(z, t) = -Eoe^-^y, c or (taking the real part) E(z, t) = Eocos(kz - cot + <5)x, B(z, t) = -E 0c Os(A:z -cot +<5)y. (9.48) c 5 Because the real part of E differs from the imaginary part only in the replacement of sine by cosine, if the former obeys Maxwell’s equations, so does the latter, and hence E as well. 9.2. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN VACUUM 379 Figure 9.10 This is the paradigm for a monochromatic plane wave (see Fig. 9.10). The wave as a whole is said to be polarized in the jc direction (by convention, we use the direction of E to specify the polarization of an electromagnetic wave). There is nothing special about the z direction, of course—we can easily generalize to monochromatic plane waves traveling in an arbitrary direction. The notation is facilitated by the introduction of the propagation (or wave) vector, k, pointing in the direction of propagation, whose magnitude is the wave number k. The scalar product k • r is the appropriate generalization of kz (Fig. 9.11), so E(r, t) = £ 0«i(k'r_a’0 n, B(r, t) = -V^'^tkxn) = -kxE, c c (9.49) where n is the polarization vector. Because E is transverse, n • k = 0. (9.50) Figure 9.11 9.2. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN VACUUM 381 cAt Figure 9.12 Electromagnetic fields not only carry energy, they also carry momentum. In fact, we found in Eq. 8.30 that the momentum density stored in the fields is P = (9.58) For monochromatic plane waves, then, 1 2 2 „ 1 A p = -eoE G cos (kz — cot + 8) z = -u z. c c (9.59) In the case of light, the wavelength is so short (~ 5 x 10-7 m), and the period so brief (~ 10-15 s), that any macroscopic measurement will encompass many cycles. Typically, therefore, we’re not interested in the fluctuating cosine-squared term in the energy and momentum densities; all we want is the average value. Now, the average of cosine-squared over a complete cycle6 is 5, so (u) = ^<?0 El, (9.60) (S) = z- (9-61) (P) = ^~€oEq z. (9.62) 2 c I use brackets, ( ), to denote the (time) average over a complete cycle (or many cycles, if you prefer). The average power per unit area transported by an electromagnetic wave is called the intensity: / = (S) = \\ce 0E l (9.63) 6There is a cute trick for doing this in your head: sin2 $ + cos2 0 = 1, and over a complete cycle the average of sin2 0 is equal to the average of cos2 0, so (sin2) = (cos2) = 1 /2. More formally, 1 (T — I cos2 (kz — 2jtt/T + S) dt = 1/2. T Jo 382 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES When light falls on a perfect absorber it delivers its momentum to the surface. In a time At the momentum transfer is (Fig. 9.12) Ap = {p)Ac At, so the radiation pressure (average force per unit area) is 1 Ap A At (9.64) (On a perfect reflector the pressure is twice as great, because the momentum switches direction, instead of simply being absorbed.) We can account for this pressure qualitatively, as follows: The electric field (Eq. 9.48) drives charges in the x direction, and the magnetic field then exerts on them a force (qxx B) in the z direction. The net force on all the charges in the surface produces the pressure. Problem 9.10 The intensity of sunlight hitting the earth is about 1300 W/m 2. If sunlight strikes a perfect absorber, what pressure does it exert? How about a perfect reflector? What fraction of atmospheric pressure does this amount to? Problem 9.11 In the complex notation there is a clever device for finding the time average of a product. Suppose /( r, t) = A cos (k • r — cot + Sa) and g(r, t) = B cos (k   r - cut + 8h). Show that (fg) = (l/2)Re(/g*), where the star denotes complex conjugation. [Note that this only works if the two waves have the same k and co, but they need not have the same amplitude or phase.] For example («> = -Re(e 0E • E* + — B • B*) and (S) =-Re(E x B*). 4 Mo 2p.Q Problem 9.12 Find all elements of the Maxwell stress tensor for a monochromatic plane wave traveling in the z direction and linearly polarized in the x direction (Eq. 9.48). Does your answer make sense? (Remember that T represents the momentum flux density.) How is the momentum flux density related to the energy density, in this case?

For most materials, /x is very close to /iq, so n = JT r, (9.70) where e, is the dielectric constant (Eq. 4.34). Since er is almost always greater than 1, light travels more slowly through matter—a fact that is well known from optics. All of our previous results carry over, with the simple transcription eo -> e, Eo — * E, and hence c —>  v (see Prob. 8.15). The energy density is8 u 1 2 eE 2 + -B 2 E (9.71) and the Poynting vector is S = —(Ex B). (9.72) h For monochromatic plane waves the frequency and wave number are related by co = kv (Eq. 9.11), the amplitude of B is l/v times the amplitude of E (Eq. 9.47), and the intensity is / = UvE 2. (9.73) 7This observation is mathematically pretty trivial, but the physical implications are astonishing: As the wave passes through, the fields busily polarize and magnetize all the molecules, and the resulting (oscillating) dipoles create their own electric and magnetic fields. These combine with the original fields in such a way as to create a single wave with the same frequency but a different speed. This extraordinary conspiracy is responsible for the phenomenon of transparency. It is a distinctly nontrivial consequence of the linearity of the medium. For further discussion see M. B. James and D. J. Griffiths, Am. J. Phys. 60, 309 (1992). sRefer to Sect. 4.4.3 for the precise meaning of “energy density,” in the-eontext of linear media. 384 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES The interesting question is this: What happens when a wave passes from one transparent medium into another—air to water, say, or glass to plastic? As in the case of waves on a string, we expect to get a reflected wave and a transmitted wave. The details depend on the exact nature of the electrodynamic boundary conditions, which we derived in Chapter 7 (Eq. 7.64): (i) ei£jL = e2£ f, (in) E 1,1 = E|, (ii) = B^, (iv) —Bf = —bI. Ml M2 These equations relate the electric and magnetic fields just to the left and just to the right of the interface between two linear media. In the following sections we use them to deduce the laws governing reflection and refraction of electromagnetic waves. 9.3.2 Reflection and Transmission at Normal Incidence Suppose the xy plane forms the boundary between two linear media. A plane wave of frequency u>, traveling in the z direction and polarized in the x direction, approaches the interface from the left (Fig. 9.13): E,(z,t) = E 0le i{k'z-^ x, B/(z,f) = -Eo.eW't-^y. vi (9.75) It gives rise to a reflected wave E/f (z, t) = EoRe l( klZ M)x , Bx(Z,() = --4e i(-^- a\")y, ifi (9.76) Figure 9.13 9.3. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN MATTER 385 which travels back to the left in medium (1), and a transmitted wave Et ( zJ) = E 0Te i(k2Z- Mt) x, B T( z,t) = V2 (9.77) which continues on the the right in medium (2). Note the minus sign in BA>, as required by Eq. 9.49—or, if you prefer, by the fact that the Poynting vector aims in the direction of propagation. At z = 0, the combined fields on the left, E/ + E/j and B/ + B/?, must join the fields on the right, Ey and By, in accordance with the boundary conditions 9.74. In this case there are no components perpendicular to the surface, so (i) and (ii) are trivial. However, (iii) requires that Eq, + Eqr = z Eot ) (9.78) while (iv) says — (~Eq, ~ -Eqr) = — (-^o r) , A2 \\V 2 ) (9.79) or Eq, ~ Eqr — PEqt, (9.80) where P= 1111)1 = IJ-2V2 Al«2 A2«l ' (9.81) Equations 9.78 and 9.80 are easily solved for the outgoing amplitudes, in terms of the incident amplitude: ^ = ^ = <9 -82) These results are strikingly similar to the ones for waves on a string. Indeed, if the permittivities /x are close to their values in vacuum (as, remember, they are for most media), then ft = i> i / 1 >2, and we have E0r V2 ~ V] V2 + V\\ Eq,, Eqj 2v2 V2 + V\\ Eq,, (9.83) which are identical to Eqs. 9.30.

ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES What fraction of the incident energy is reflected, and what fraction is transmitted? According to Eq. 9.73, the intensity (average power per unit area) is / = 1 -€VE 2 2 o- If (again) /i| = M2 = Mo, then the ratio of the reflected intensity to the incident intensity is =(^y =( nx - JI V E 0, ) +n 2) ’ whereas the ratio of the transmitted intensity to the incident intensity is (9.86) Ij_ _ (2V2 / Eqt \\ 2 _ 4n\\n2 lj €iV] \\ Eq, ) (m + n2)2 ' (9.87) R is called the reflection coefficient and T the transmission coefficient; they measure the fraction of the incident energy that is reflected and transmitted, respectively. Notice that R + T= 1, (9.88) as conservation of energy, of course, requires. For instance, when light passes from air (ni — 1) into glass (n2 — 1.5), R = 0.04 artd T = 0.96. Not surprisingly, most of the light is transmitted. Problem 9.13 Calculate the exact reflection and transmission coefficients, without assuming Ml = M2 = MO- Confirm that R + T = 1. Problem 9.14 In writing Eqs. 9.76 and 9.77,1 tacitly assumed that the reflected and transmitted waves have the sam & polarization as the incident wave—along the x direction. Prove that this must be so. [Hint: Let the polarization vectors of the transmitted and reflected waves be fij- = cos 9j x + sin 6j y, Ar = cos Or x + sin 0R y, and prove from the boundary conditions that 6j = Or = 0.] 9.3.3 Reflection and Transmission at Oblique Incidence In the last section I treated reflection and transmission at normal incidence—that is, when the incoming wave hits the interface head-on. We now turn to the more general case of oblique incidence, in which the incoming wave meets the boundary at an arbitrary angle 6/ (Fig. 9.14). Of course, normal incidence is really just a special case of oblique incidence, with 6/ = 0, but I wanted to treat it separately, as a kind of warm-up, because the algebra is now going to get a little heavy. 9.3. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN MATTER 387 Figure 9.14 Suppose, then, that a monochromatic plane wave E/(r, t) = E 0 B/(r, t) = — (k/ x E/) (9.89) vi approaches from the left, giving rise to a reflected wave, ER(r, f) = EoRe ''(k*'r-\" ?\\ B«(r, /) = -(k R x t R), (9.90) and a transmitted wave Er (r, t) = E 0re '(kr'r“\" 0, Br ( r, t) = — (kT x Er ). (9.91) V2 All three waves have the samc frequency a>—that is determined once and for all at the source (the flashlight, or whatever, that produces the incident beam). The three wave numbers are related by Eq. 9.11: V2 n\\ kjvi = kftVi = kjV 2 — co, or kj = kR — —kr = — kj. (9.92) ni n2 The combined fields in medium (1), E/ + E/,> and B/ + B/,>, must now be joined to the fields E 7 - and B/ in medium (2), using the boundary conditions 9.74. These all share the generic structure ( y'(k/-r-“0 + ( = ( )ei(kr-r-a.f)i at z = 0. (9.93) I’ll fill in the parentheses in a moment; for now, the important thing to notice is that the x, y, and t dependence is confined to the exponents. Because the boundary conditions must hold at all points on the plane, and for all times, these exponential factors must be equal. Otherwise, a slight change in x, say, would destroy the equality (see Prob. 9.15). Of 388 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES course, the time factors are already equal (in fact, you could regard this as an independent confirmation that the transmitted and reflected frequencies must match the incident one). As for the spatial terms, evidently k/ • r = k/; r = r, when z = 0 , (9 .94 ) or, more explicitly, X(ki)x + y(kj)y = x(kR)x + y(kR)y = x{kj)x + y(kr)y, (9.95) for all x and all y. But Eq. 9.95 can only hold if the components are separately equal, for if x = 0, we get (ki)y = (kR)y = (kr)y, (9.96) while y = 0 gives (ki)x = (kR)x = (kT)x. (9.97) We may as well orient our axes so that k, lies in the x z plane (i.e. (k,)y = 0); according to Eq. 9.96, so too will kw and ky . Conclusion: First Law: The incident, reflected, and transmitted wave vectors form a plane (called the plane of incidence), which also includes the normal to the surface (here, the z axis). Meanwhile, Eq. 9.97 implies that kI sin 6/ = kR sin Or = kT sin 0 T, (9.98) where 0/ is the angle of incidence, 0 R is the angle of reflection, and 0 T is the angle of transmission, more commonly known as the angle of refraction, all of them measured with respect to the normal (Fig. 9.14). In view of Eq. 9.92, then, Second Law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, Oi = 0 R. (9.99) This is the law of reflection. As for the transmitted angle. Third Law: sin Qj sin#/ «2 This is the law of refraction, or Snell’s law. (9.100) 9.3. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN MATTER 389 These are the three fundamental laws of geometrical optics. It is remarkable how little actual electrodynamics went into them: we have yet to invoke any specific boundary conditions—all we used was their generic form (Eq. 9.93). Therefore, any other waves (water waves, for instance, or sound waves) can be expected to obey the same “optical” laws when they pass from one medium into another. Now that we have taken care of the exponential factors—they cancel, given Eq. 9.94— the boundary conditions 9.74 become: (i) ei(E0/ + Eo„)z = e2(EoT)z (ii) (Bo, + B0fl)z = (®0r) z (iii) (Eo, + Eo*)*,? = (Eot-)jc,^ 1 - - 1 - (iv) (Eo, \"FBo*)*,? — (Bo?)*,? rii ri-2 (9.101) where Bq = (l/u)k x Eo in each case. (The last two represent pairs of equations, one for the x-component and one for the y-component.) Suppose that the polarization of the incident wave is parallel to the plane of incidence (the x z plane in Fig. 9.15); it follows (see Prob. 9.14) that the reflected and transmitted waves are also polarized in this plane. (I shall leave it for you to analyze the case of polarization perpendicular to the plane of incidence; see Prob. 9.16.) Then (i) reads €\\(-Eq, sin6 j + £ 0* sindR) = €2(-Eq t sin£ 7-); (9.102) (ii) adds nothing (0 = 0 ), since the magnetic fields have no z components; (iii) becomes Eq, cos 6] + Eqr cos 9r = Eqt cos Or; (9.103) Figure 9.15 390 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES and (iv) says (£o, E0r) - E0t. P\\V\\ PL2V 2 (9.104) Given the laws of reflection and refraction, Eqs. 9.102 and 9.104 both reduce to Eq, - Eqr — PEqt , (9.105) where (as before) p ini p\\n 2 P - = P 2V2 p 2n\\ (9.106) and Eq. 9.103 says Eq, + Eqr = a Eqt , (9.107) where cos 9j a =-. COS#/ (9.108) Solving Eqs. 9.105 and 9.107 for the reflected and transmitted amplitudes, we obtain (9.109) These are known as Fresnel’s equations, for the case of polarization in the plane of inci¬ dence. (There are two other Fresnel equations, giving the reflected and transmitted ampli¬ tudes when the polarization is perpendicular to the plane of incidence—see Prob. 9.16.) Notice that the transmitted wave is always in phase with the incident one; the reflected wave is either in phase (“right side up”), if « > y3, or 180° out of phase (“upside down”), if a < p.9 The amplitudes of the transmitted and reflected waves depend on the angle of incidence, because a is a function of 9j: ~ [(ni/n 2 ) sing/]2 cos 9j (9.110) In the case of normal incidence (#/ = 0), a = 1, and we recover Eq. 9.82. At grazing incidence (9j = 90°), a diverges, and the wave is totally reflected (a fact that is painfully familiar to anyone who has driven at night on a wet road). Interestingly, there is an in¬ termediate angle, 9B (called Brewster’s angle), at which the reflected wave is completely extinguished.10 According to Eq. 9.109, this occurs when a = ft, or sin 9b = Cn\\/n 2 ) 2 - P2' (9.111) There is an unavoidable ambiguity in the phase of the reflected wave, since (as I mentioned in footnote 2) changing the sign of the polarization vector is equivalent to a 180° phase shift. The convention I adopted in Fig. 9.15, with Es positive “upward,” is consistent with some, but not all, of the standard optics texts. Because waves polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence exhibit no corresponding quenching of the reflected component, an arbitrary beam incident at Brewster’s angle yields a reflected beam that is totally polarized parallel to the interface. That’s why Polaroid glasses, with the transmission axis vertical, help to reduce glare off a horizontal surface. 9.3.

Problem 9.16 Analyze the case of polarization perpendicular to the plane of incidence (i.e. electric fields in the y direction, in Fig. 9.15).

Confirm that your Fresnel equations reduce to the proper forms at normal incidence. Compute the reflection and transmission coefficients, and check that they add up to 1. Problem 9.17 The index of refraction of diamond is 2.42. Construct the graph analogous to Fig. 9.16 for the air/diamond interface. (Assume mi = M2 = M0-) In particular, calculate (a) the amplitudes at normal incidence, (b) Brewster’s angle, and (c) the “crossover” angle, at which the reflected and transmitted amplitudes are equal. M Absorption and Dispersion 9,44 Electromagnetic Waves in Conductors In Sect. 9.3 I stipulated that the free charge density pp and the free current density Jy are zero, and everything that followed was predicated on that assumption. Such a restriction 9.4. ABSORPTION AND DISPERSION 393 is perfectly reasonable when you’re talking about wave propagation through a vacuum or through insulating materials such as glass or (pure) water. But in the case of conductors we do not independently control the flow of charge, and in general J/ is certainly not zero. In fact, according to Ohm’s law, the (free) current density in a conductor is proportional to the electric field: if = crE. (9.117) With this, Maxwell’s equations for linear media assume the form 1 9B (i) V • E = -pf, (iii) V x E =-, e dt (ii) V • B = 0, (iv) VxB = ncr E + /re 9E ~dt' Now the continuity equation for free charge v J/ = - together with Ohm’s law and Gauss’s law (i), gives dpf_ dt ’ dpf_ dt = -o\"(V • E) = -~p f € for a homogeneous linear medium, from which it follows that (9.118) (9.119) Pf(t)=e-^ tpf(0). (9.120) Thus any initial free charge density p/ (0) dissipates in a characteristic time r = e/o. This reflects the familiar fact that if you put some free charge on a conductor, it will flow out to the edges. The time constant r affords a measure of how “good” a conductor is: For a “perfect” conductor o = oo and r = 0; for a “good” conductor, r is much less than the other relevant times in the problem (in oscillatory systems, that means r <C 1 /a>): for a “poor” conductor, r is greater than the characteristic times in the problem (r I jot)} 1 At present we’re not interested in this transient behavior—we’ll wait for any accumulated free charge to disappear. From then on p f = 0. and we have 9B (i) V • E = 0, (iii) V x E =-, dt 9E (n) V • B = 0, (iv) V x B = /re-f /ruE. dt (9.121) ]1N. Ashby, Am. J. Phys. 43, 553 (1975), points out that for good conductors r is absurdly short (10“19 s, for copper, whereas the time between collisions is rc = 10~14 s). The problem is that Ohm’s law itself breaks down on time scales shorter than rc; actually, the time it takes free charge to dissipate in a good conductor is of order rc, not r. Moreover, H. C. Ohanian, Am. J. Phys. 51, 1020 (1983), shows that it takes even longer for the fields and currents to equilibrate. But none of this is relevant to our present purpose; the free charge density in a conductor does eventually dissipate, and exactly how long the process takes is beside the point. 394 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES These differ from the corresponding equations for nonconducting media (9.67) only in the addition of the last term in (iv). Applying the curl to (iii) and (iv), as before, we obtain modified wave equations for E and B: , 92E 9E 7 92B 9B VE = '‘f 972 +'\"’aT- VB = ^w + l^JT (9J22) These equations still admit plane-wave solutions, E(z, t) = t 0ei{kz- m\\ B(z, t) = B0ei(fe“\" 0, (9.123) but this time the “wave number” k is complex: k2 = ixeco2 + iixaco, (9.124) as you can easily check by plugging Eq. 9.123 into Eq. 9.122. Taking the square root, k — k + iK, (9.125) where The imaginary part of k results in an attenuation of the wave (decreasing amplitude with increasing z): E(z, t) = t 0e- KZei(kz~Mt\\ B(z, t) = B0e“ KZe,(fe“\" r). (9.127) The distance it takes to reduce the amplitude by a factor of 1 je (about a third) is called the skin depth: d=-\\ (9.128) K it is a measure of how far the wave penetrates into the conductor. Meanwhile, the real part of k determines the wavelength, the propagation speed, and the index of refraction, in the usual way: (9.129) The attenuated plane waves (Eq. 9.127) satisfy the modified wave equation (9.122) for any Eo and Bo- But Maxwell’s equations (9.121) impose further constraints, which serve to determine the relative amplitudes, phases, and polarizations of E and B. As before, (i) and (ii) rule out qny z components: the fields are transverse. We may as well orient our axes so that E is polarized along the x direction: E(z, t) = E 0e- KZe i(kz- Mt) x.

Once again, the electric and magnetic fields are mutually perpendicular. Like any complex number, k can be expressed in terms of its modulus and phase: k = Kei’t>, (9.132) where K = \\k\\ = s/k2 +k 2= co^e/x^l + (9.133) and 4> =iw~ l(K/k).

Meanwhile, the (real) amplitudes of E and B are related by Bo Eo (9.137) The (real) electric and magnetic fields are, finally, E(z, t) = Eoe Kz cos (kz — cot + Se)x, B(z, t) = Boe~KZ cos {kz — cot + Se + cp) y.

Instead, we have the more general relations (7.63): (i) ei£f - €2^2 = CT/> (iii) Ej - = 0, (ii) Bf - Bf = 0, (iv) —B Ml M2 = Kf x n, (9.139) where ay (not to be confused with conductivity) is the free surface charge, Ky the free surface current, and n (not to be confused with the polarization of the wave) is a unit 9.4. ABSORPTION AND DISPERSION 397 vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing from medium (2) into medium (1). For ohmic conductors (J/ = aE) there can be no free surface current, since this would require an infinite electric field at the boundary. Suppose now that the xy plane forms the boundary between a nonconducting linear medium (1) and a conductor (2). A monochromatic plane wave, traveling in the z direction and polarized in the x direction, approaches from the left, as in Fig. 9.13: E/(z, t) = £ 0/e i(tlz_a,,) x, B/(Z> 0 = -E 0le i{k'z~M,) y. (9.140) vi This incident wave gives rise to a reflected wave, E*(z, t) = x, BR(z, t) = --Eo Rei{-^ z~^ y, (9.141) vi propagating back to the left in medium (1) , and a transmitted wave ET(z, t) = E0Te i(~hz~wt) x, BT(z, t) = -£ 0^'^-^ y, (9.142) co which is attenuated as it penetrates into the conductor. At z = 0, the combined wave in medium (1) must join the wave in medium (2), pursuant to the boundary conditions 9.139. Since E1 = 0 on both sides, boundary condition (i) yields Of = 0. Since B1- — 0, (ii) is automatically satisfied. Meanwhile, (iii) gives E0i+ E 0r= E 0t, (9.143) and (iv) (with Kf = 0) says or where It follows that 1 ~ k2 ~ - (Eo, ~ Eor)- E ot = 0, Mi vi H2(d Eo, - E0r — /3Eot P = —* 2- H20> Eqr = l+y jEo„ £or- ( i+^ £ 0/ (9.144) (9.145) (9.146) (9.147) These results are formally identical to the ones that apply at the boundary between nonconductors (Eq. 9.82), but the resemblance is deceptive since is now a complex number. For a perfect conductor (a = oo), k2 = oo (Eq. 9.126), so is infinite, and — Eq,, Eqt = 0. Eqr — (9.148) 398 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES In this case the wave is totally reflected, with a 180° phase shift. (That’s why excellent conductors make good mirrors. In practice, you paint a thin coating of silver onto the back of a pane of glass—the glass has nothing to do with the reflection; it’s just there to support the silver and to keep d from tarnishing. Since the skin depth in silver at optical frequencies is on the order of 100 A, you don’t need a very thick layer.) Problem 9.21 Calculate the reflection coefficient for light at an air-to-silver interface (/x j = M2 = MO’ el = e0> a = 6 x 107( Q   m)_ 1) , at optical frequencies (&> = 4 x 1015/s). 9.4.3 The Frequency Dependence of Permittivity In the preceding sections, we have seen that the propagation of electromagnetic waves through matter is governed by three properties of the material, which we took to be constants: the permittivity f. the permeability /i. and the conductivity a. Actually, each of these parameters depends to some extent on the frequency of the waves you are considering. Indeed, if the permittivity were truly constant, then the index of refraction in a transparent medium, n = would also be constant. But it is well known from optics that n is a function of wavelength (Fig. 9.19 shows the graph for a typical glass). A prism or a raindrop bends blue light more sharply than red, and spreads white light out into a rainbow of colors. This phenomenon is called dispersion. By extension, whenever the speed of a wave depends on its frequency, the supporting medium is called dispersive.12 Wavelength, X (in air) Figure 9.19 1 Conductors, incidentally, are dispersive: see Eqs. 9.126 and 9.129. 9.4. ABSORPTION AND DISPERSION 399 Because waves of different frequency travel at different speeds in a dispersive medium, a wave form that incorporates a range of frequencies will change shape as it propagates. A sharply peaked wave typically flattens out, and whereas each sinusoidal component travels at the ordinary wave (or phase) velocity, co u = -, (9.149) the packet as a whole (the “envelope”) travels at the so-called group velocity13 dco = Tk- (9 -1 5 0) [You can demonstrate this by dropping a rock into the nearest pond and watching the waves that form: While the disturbance as a whole spreads out in a circle, moving at speed vg, the ripples that go to make it up will be seen to travel twice as fast (v = 2vg in this case). They appear at the back end of the packet, growing as they move forward to the center, then shrinking again and fading away at the front (Fig. 9.20).] We shall not concern ourselves with these matters—I’ll stick to monochromatic waves, for which the problem does not arise. But I should just mention that the energy carried by a wave packet in a dispersive medium ordinarily travels at the group velocity, not the phase velocity. Don’t be too alarmed, therefore, if in some circumstances v comes out greater than c.14 Figure 9.20 My purpose in this section is to account for the frequency dependence of e in nonconduc¬ tors, using a simplified model for the behavior of electrons in dielectrics. Like all classical models of atomic-scale phenomena, it is at best an approximation to the truth; nevertheless, it does yield qualitatively satisfactory results, and it provides a plausible mechanism for dispersion in transparent media. The electrons in a nonconductor are bound to specific molecules. The actual binding forces can be quite complicated, but we shall picture each electron as attached to the end of an imaginary spring, with force constant ksprjng (Fig- 9.21): ^binding — ^springY — UICOqX, (9.151) 13S ee A. P. French, Vibrations and Waves, p. 230 (New York: W. W. Norton & Co., 1971), or F. S. Crawford, Jr., Waves, Sect. 6.2 (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1968). u Even the group velocity can exceed c in special cases—see P. C. Peters, Am. J. Phys. 56, 129 (1988). Incidentally, if two different “speeds of light” are not enough to satisfy you, check out S. C. Bloch, Am. J. Phys. 45, 538 (1977), in which no fewer than eight distinct velocities are identified! 400 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES Figure 9.21 where x is displacement from equilibrium, m is the electron’s mass, and ojq is the natural oscillation frequency, jk spTing/m . [If this strikes you as an implausible model, look back at Ex. 4.1, where we were led to a force of precisely this form. As a matter of fact, practically any binding force can be approximated this way for sufficiently small displacements from equilibrium, as you can see by expanding the potential energy in a Taylor series about the equilibrium point: U(x) = U(0)+xU'(0) + i x2U”(0) 4-   • • . The first term is a constant, with no dynamical significance (you can always adjust the zero of potential energy so that U (0) = 0). The second term automatically vanishes, since dU/dx = —F, and by the nature of an equilibrium the force at that point is zero. The third term is precisely the potential energy of a spring with force constant £spring = d2U/dx21 (the second derivative is positive, for a point of stable equilibrium). As long as the displacements are small, the higher terms in the series can be neglected. Geometrically, all I am saying is that virtually any function can be fit near a minimum by a suitable parabola.] Meanwhile, there will presumably be some damping force on the electron: dx ^damping — ~^Y * (9.152) [Again I have chosen the simplest possible form; the damping must be opposite in direction to the velocity, and making it proportional to the velocity is the easiest way to accomplish this. The cause of the damping does not concern us here—among other things, an oscillating charge radiates, and the radiation siphons off energy. We will calculate this “radiation damping” in Chapter 11.] In the presence of an electromagnetic wave of frequency to, polarized in the x direction (Fig. 9.21), the electron is subject to a driving force ^driving = qE = qE0c os(wt), (9.153) where q is the charge of the electron and Eq is the amplitude of the wave at the point c where the electron is situated. (Since we’re only interested in one point, I have reset the clock so that the maximum E occurs there at t = 0.) Putting all this into Newton’s second law gives d2x tn 2 — ^tot = ^binding + ^damping + F driving > 9.4. ABSORPTION AND DISPERSION 401 or x dx m-^+my—+mcolx=qEocos(cot). (9.154) Our model, then, describes the electron as a damped harmonic oscillator, driven at frequency co. (I assume that the much more massive nuclei remain at rest.) Equation 9.154 is easier to handle if we regard it as the real part of a complex equation: d2x dt2 dx dt   coix = — E$e m (9.155) In the steady state, the system oscillates at the driving frequency: x (t) = XQe lcot Inserting this into Eq. 9.155, we obtain (9.156) q/m x o = — 2- t.-;- E q. coQ — coA — lyco (9.157) The dipole moment is the real part of Q2 j ffl p{t) = qx(t) = - r - '- E 0e- lcot. (9.158) cog — coz — iyco The imaginary term in the denominator means that p is out of phase with E—lagging behind by an angle tan-1 [ycoj{u>l - co2)] that is very small when co <«C ojq and rises to it when co^> coq>. In general, differently situated electrons within a given molecule experience different natural frequencies and damping coefficients. Let’s say there are fj electrons with frequency coj and damping yj in each molecule. If there are N molecules per unit volume, the polarization P is given by15 the real part of P = Nq2 m iyjco E. (9.159) Now, I defined the electric susceptibility as the proportionality constant between P and E (specifically, P = eoy>E). In the present case P is not proportional to E (this is not, strictly speaking, a linear medium) because of the difference in phase. However, the complex polarization P is proportional to the complex field E, and this suggests that we introduce a complex susceptibility, Xe- P = e0X«E. (9.160) 15This applies directly to the case of a dilute gas; for denser materials the theory is modified slightly, in accordance with the Clausius-Mossotti equation (Prob. 4.38). By the way, don’t confuse the “polarization” of a medium, P, with the “polarization” of a wave—same word, but two completely unrelated meanings. 402 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES All of the manipulations we went through before carry over, on the understanding that the physical polarization is the real part of P, just as the physical field is the real part of E. In particular, the proportionality between D and E is the complex permittivity e = eo (1 + Xe), and the complex dielectric constant (in this model) is 1 + Nq2 me o E iyjco (9.161) Ordinarily, the imaginary term is negligible; however, when co is very close to one of the resonant frequencies (coj) it plays an important role, as we shall see. In a dispersive medium the wave equation for a given frequency reads V2E = eji o 32E ~dt2’ ’ it admits plane wave solutions, as before, (9.162) E(z, t) = t 0ei(kz- wt\\ (9.163) with the complex wave number k = ^enoM. (9.164) Writing k in terms of its real and imaginary parts, k = k + iK, (9.165) Eq. 9.163 becomes E(z, t) = E^e-Kzei(kz~wt). (9.166) Evidently the wave is attenuated (this is hardly surprising, since the damping absorbs energy). Because the intensity is proportional to E2 (and hence to e 2>cz), the quantity a = 2k (9.167) is called the absorption coefficient. Meanwhile, the wave velocity is co/k, and the index of refraction is rk n = —. (9.168) a> I have deliberately used notation reminiscent of Sect. 9.4.1. However, in the present case k and k have nothing to do with conductivity; rather, they are determined by the parameters of our damped harmonic oscillator. For gases, the second term in Eq. 9.161 is small, and we can approximate the square root (Eq. 9.164) by the first term in the binomial expansion. \\/l + £ = 1 + j£.

Most of the time the index of refraction rises gradually with increasing frequency, consistent with our experience from optics (Fig. 9.19). However, in the immediate neighborhood of a resonance the index of refraction drops sharply. Because this behavior is atypical, it is called anomalous dispersion. Notice that the region of anomalous dispersion (&>i < co < co2, in the figure) coincides with the region of maximum absorption; in fact, the material may be practically opaque in this frequency range. The reason is that we are now driving the electrons at their “favorite” frequency; the amplitude of their oscillation is relatively large, and a correspondingly large amount of energy is dissipated by the damping mechanism. In Fig. 9.22, n runs below 1 above the resonance, suggesting that the wave speed exceeds c. As I mentioned earlier, this is no cause for alarm, since energy does not travel at the wave velocity but rather at the group velocity (see Prob. 9.25). Moreover, the graph does not include the contributions of other terms in the sum, which add a relatively constant “background” that, in some cases, keeps n > 1 on both sides of the resonance. 404 CHAPTER 9.

Cauchy’s equation applies reasonably well to most gases, in the optical region. What I have described in this section is certainly not the complete story of dispersion in nonconducting media. Nevertheless, it does indicate how the damped harmonic motion of electrons can account for the frequency dependence of the index of refraction, and it explains why n is ordinarily a slowly increasing function of co, with occasional “anomalous” regions where it precipitously drops. Pr oblem 9.22 (a) Shallow water is nondispersive; the waves travel at a speed that is proportional to the square root of the depth. In deep water, however, the waves can’t “feel” all the way down to the bottom—they behave as though the depth were proportional to X. (Actually, the distinction between “shallow” and “deep” itself depends on the wavelength: If the depth is less than X the water is “shallow”; if it is substantially greater than X the water is “deep.”) Show that the wave velocity of deep water waves is twice the group velocity. (b) In quantum mechanics, a free particle of mass m traveling in the x direction is described by the wave function V(x,t) = Aei(Px~Et)ln, where p is the momentum, and E = p 2/2m is the kinetic energy. Calculate the group velocity and the wave velocity. Which one corresponds to the classical speed of the particle? Note that the wave velocity is half the group velocity. 9.5. GUIDED WAVES 405 Problem 9.23 If you take the model in Ex. 4.1 at face value, what natural frequency do you get? Put in the actual numbers. Where, in the electromagnetic spectrum, does this lie, assuming the radius of the atom is 0.5 A? Find the coefficients of refraction and dispersion and compare them with those for hydrogen at 0°C and atmospheric pressure: A = 1.36 x 10~4, B = 7.7 x 10“15m 2.

Show that vg < c, even when v > c. 9.5 Guided Waves 9.5.1 Wave Guides So far, we have dealt with plane waves of infinite extent; now we consider electromagnetic waves confined to the interior of a hollow pipe, or wave guide (Fig. 9.23). We’ll assume the wave guide is a perfect conductor, so that E = 0 and B = 0 inside the material itself, and hence the boundary conditions at the inner wall are16 (i) E 11 = 0, (ii) Bl = 0. (9.175) Figure 9.23 16See Eq. 9.139 and Prob. 7.42. In a perfect conductor E = 0, and hence (by Faraday’s law) 3B/3f = 0; assuming the magnetic field started out zero, then, it will remain so. 406 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES Free charges and currents will be induced on the surface in such a way as to enforce these constraints. We are interested in monochromatic waves that propagate down the tube, so E and B have the generic form (i) E(x, y, z, t) = Eo(jc, y)el^kz (ii) B(x, y, z, t) = Bo(jc, y)ei{kz- mt) (9.176) (For the cases of interest k is real, so I shall dispense with the tilde.) The electric and magnetic fields must, of course, satisfy Maxwell’s equations, in the interior of the wave guide: (i) V • E = 0, 3B (m) V x E = - —, dt (ii) V • B = 0. (iv) V x B = 1 3E c2 31 (9.177) The problem, then, is to find functions Eo and B0 such that the fields (9.176) obey the differential equations (9.177), subject to boundary conditions (9.175). As we shall soon see, confined waves are not (in general) transverse; in order to fit the boundary conditions we shall have to include longitudinal components (Ez and Bz):11 E0 = Exx + Eyy + Ezz , B0 = Bx x + By y + Bz z, (9.178) where each of the components is a function of x and y.

Inserting Eq. 9.180 into the remaining Maxwell equations (Prob. 9.26b) yields uncoupled equations for Ez and Bz : (i) (ii) r 32 32 2 d^ + J^ + (co/c) U (J 0 O Ez = 0, Bz= 0. (9.181) If Ez = 0 we call these TE (“transverse electric”) waves; if B- = 0 they are called TM (“transverse magnetic”) waves; if both Ez = 0 and B- = 0, we call them TEM waves.18 It turns out that TElVf waves cannot occur in a hollow wave guide. Proof: If Ez = 0, Gauss’s law (Eq. 9.177i) says 3 Ex 3 Ey —- + — y- = 0, dx dy and if Bz = 0, Faraday’s law (Eq. 9.177iii) says 3 Ey 3 Ex dx dy Indeed, the vector Eo in Eq. 9.178 has zero divergence and zero curl. It can therefore be written as the gradient of a scalar potential that satisfies Laplace’s equation. But the boundary condition on E (Eq. 9.175) requires that the surface be an equipotential, and since Laplace’s equation admits no local maxima or minima (Sect. 3.1.4), this means that the potential is constant throughout, and hence the electric field is zero—no wave at all. qed 18In the case of TEM waves (including the unconfined plane waves of Sect. 9.2), k = w/c , Eqs. 9.180 are indeterminate, and you have to go back to Eqs. 9.179. 408 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES Notice that this argument applies only to a completely empty pipe—if you run a separate conductor down the middle, the potential at its surface need not be the same as on the outer wall, and hence a nontrivial potential is possible. We’ll see an example of this in Sect. 9.5.3. Problem 9.26 (a) Derive Eqs. 9.179, and from these obtain Eqs. 9.180. (b) Put Eq. 9.180 into Maxwell’s equations (i) and (ii) to obtain Eq. 9.181. Check that you get the same results using (i) and (iv) of Eq. 9.179. 9.5.2 TE Waves in a Rectangular Wave Guide Suppose we have a wave guide of rectangular shape (Fig. 9.24), with height a and width b, and we are interested in the propagation of TE waves. The problem is to solve Eq. 9.18 lii, subject to the boundary condition 9.175ii. We’ll do it by separation of variables. Let Bz(x,y) = X(x)Y(y), so that d2X d2Y , , Y— T + X+ [{co/cj2 - k2]XY = 0. dxz dyz Divide by XT and note that the x- and y-dependent terms must be constant: 1 d2X (i) X dx2 -ki 1 d2Y ~ <l,) = with -k2x ~k 2y + (co/c)2  k 2 = 0. (9.182) (9.183) Figure 9.24 9.5. GUIDED WAVES 409 The general solution to Eq. 9.182i is X(x) = A sin (kxx) + B cos (kxx). But the boundary conditions require that Bx—and hence also (Eq. 9.180iii) dX/dx— vanishes at x = 0 and x = a. So A = 0, and kx = mn/a, (m = 0, 1,2, ...). (9.184) The same goes for Y, with ky — mt/b, (n = 0, 1,2,...), (9.185) and we conclude that Bz = B0 cos (mnx/a) cos (nny/b). (9.186) This solution is called the TEm„ mode. (The first index is conventionally associated with the larger dimension, so we assume a > b. By the way, at least one of the indices must be nonzero—see Prob. 9.27.) The wave number (k) is obtained by putting Eqs. 9.184 and 9.185 into Eq. 9.183: k — J (co/c)2 — jr2[(m/a) 2 + (n/b )2]. (9.187) If a> < CTT^j(m/a)2 + (n/b)2 = comn, (9.188) the wave number is imaginary, and instead of a traveling wave we have exponentially attenuated fields (Eq. 9.176). For this reason comn is called the cutoff frequency for the mode in question. The lowest cutoff frequency for a given wave guide occurs for the mode TEio: co\\c = CTt/a. (9.189) Frequencies less than this will not propagate at all. The wave number can be written more simply in terms of the cutoff frequency: * = -J^-ooln- (9.190) The wave velocity is co c V = J = ^= , (9-191) k y/\\ - (COmn/ co)2 which is greater than c. However (see Prob. 9.29), the energy carried by the wave travels at the group velocity (Eq. 9.150): dk/dco = CyJ 1 - (COmn/co)2 < C. (9.192) 410 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES sXXXXXxxxxxxxxV'XXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Figure 9.25 There’s another way to visualize the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a rect¬ angular pipe, and it serves to illuminate many of these results. Consider an ordinary plane wave, traveling at an angle 9 to the i axis, and reflecting perfectly off each conducting surface (Fig. 9.25). In the x and y directions the (multiply reflected) waves interfere to form standing wave patterns, of wavelength av = 2a/m and Xy = 2b/n (hence wave num¬ ber kx = 2jt/a v = Ttm/a and ky = nn/b), respectively. Meanwhile, in the z direction there remains a traveling wave, with wave number kz = k. The propagation vector for the “original” plane wave is therefore , , nm A Tin „ k =- x + ~y + kz, a b and the frequency is co = c|k'| = cyjk2 + 7t2[(m/a)2 + (n/b )2] = V (ck)2 + (comn)2. Only certain angles will lead to one of the allowed standing wave patterns: cos 0 k Ik7! 1 “ i^mn/cn) 2 The plane wave travels at speed c, but because it is going at an angle 0 to the z axis, its net velocity down the wave guide is vg = c cos 0 c 1 — i^mn/cn) 2 The wave velocity, on the other hand, is the speed of the wave fronts (A, say, in Fig. 9.25) down the pipe. Like the intersection of a line of breakers with the beach, they can move much faster than the waves themselves—in fact c v =- cos 6 c y 1 i^mn /^O ) 9.5. GUIDED WAVES 411 Problem 9.27 Show that the mode TEqo cannot occur in a rectangular wave guide. [Hint: In this case <»jc = k, so Eqs. 9.180 are indeterminate, and you must go back to 9.179. Show that Bz is a constant, and hence—applying Faraday’s law in integral form to a cross section—that Bz = 0, so this would be a TEM mode.] Problem 9.28 Consider a rectangular wave guide with dimensions 2.28 cm x 1.01 cm.

[Caution: What is the lowest TM mode?] 9.5.3 The Coaxial Transmission Line In Sect. 9.5.1,1 showed that a hollow wave guide cannot support TEM waves. But a coaxial transmission line, consisting of a long straight wire of radius a, surrounded by a cylindrical conducting sheath of radius b (Fig. 9.26), does admit modes with Ez = 0 and Bz = 0. In this case Maxwell’s equations (in the form 9.179) yield k — co/c (9.193) (so the waves travel at speed c, and are nondispersive), cBy = Ex and cBx = —Ey (9.194) (so E and B are mutually perpendicular), and (together with V • E = 0, V • B = 0): dEx dEy dx 3y 3 Bx 3 By dx 3y dEy dx dEx 3 y 3 By 3 Bx dx dy = 0.

Assuming it’s a monochromatic plane wave and that it strikes the glass at normal incidence, find the minimum and maximum transmission coefficients (Eq. 9.199). You can see the fish clearly; how well can it see you? Problem 9.37 According to Snell’s law, when light passes from an optically dense medium into a less dense one (n j > n2) the propagation vector k bends away from the normal (Fig. 9.28). In particular, if the light is incident at the critical angle Bc = sin-1 (n2/ni), (9.200) then 9j = 90°, and the transmitted ray just grazes the surface. If 9j exceeds 0C, there is no refracted ray at all, only a reflected one (this is the phenomenon of total internal reflection. 414 CHAPTER 9. ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES Figure 9.28 on which light pipes and fiber optics are based). But the fields are not zero in medium 2; what we get is a so-called evanescent wave, which is rapidly attenuated and transports no energy into medium 2.19 A quick way to construct the evanescent wave is simply to quote the results of Sect. 9.3.3. with kj = a>n2/ c and = kT (sin 9T x + cos 9j z); the only change is that n\\ sin#r = — sin 4/ n2 is now greater than 1, and cos #7 = y 1 — sin2 9j = i\\j sin2 9j — 1 is imaginary.

Chapter JO Potentials and Fields 10.1 The Potential Formulation 10.1.1 Scalar and Vector Potentials In this chapter we ask how the sources (p and J) generate electric and magnetic fields; in other words, we seek the general solution to Maxwell’s equations, (i) V • E = —p , eo 9B (tii) V x E = — —, ot (ii) V • B = 0, 9E (iv) VxB = /ioJ + /i0f 0- - Ot (10 .1) Given p (r, t)andj(r, t), what are the fields E(r, r) andBfr. t)l In the static case Coulomb’s law and the Biot-Savart law provide the answer. What we’re looking for, then, is the generalization of those laws to time-dependent configurations. This is not an easy problem, and it pays to begin by representing the fields in terms of potentials. In electrostatics V x E = 0 allowed us to write E as the gradient of a scalar potential; E = — W. In electrodynamics this is no longer possible, because the curl of E is nonzero. But B remains divergenceless, so we can still write B = V x A, (10 .2) as in magnetostatics. Putting this into Faraday’s law (iii) yields v x E = - —(V x A), at or „ 9A\\ VX | E + - =°. 416 10.1. THE POTENTIAL FORMULATION 417 Here is a quantity, unlike E alone, whose curl does vanish; it cap therefore be written as the gradient of a scalar: E + 9A ~dt -VV. In terms of V and A, then, 9A E = - W - l h- (10.3) This reduces to the old form, of course, when A is constant. The potential representation (Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3) automatically fulfills the two homoge¬ neous Maxwell equations, (ii) and (iii). How about Gauss’s law (i) and the Ampere/Maxwell law (iv)? Putting Eq. 10.3 into (i), we find that O 1 V2V+ — (V-A) =- p ; (10.4) dt e0 this replaces Poisson’s equation (to which it reduces in the static case). Putting Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3 into (iv) yields V x (V x A) = /roJ MoeoV dV dt d2A or, using the vector identity V x (V x A) a bit: 92A V2A - /roeo-^y ) - V V(V A) — V2A, and rearranging the terms V • A + IM)€q dV ~dt ~li oJ- (10.5) Equations 10.4 and 10.5 contain all the information in Maxwell’s equations. Example 10.1 Find the charge and current distributions that would give rise to the potentials V = 0, A = ——— (ct — |x|)2 z, for \\x\\ < ct, Ac 0, for \\x\\ > ct. where k is a constant, and c = 1 Solution: First we’ll determine the electric and magnetic fields, using Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3: 418 CHAPTER 10. POTENTIALS AND FIELDS Figure 10.1 (plus for x > 0, minus for x < 0). These are for \\x\\ < ct; when \\x\\ > ct, E = B = 0 (Fig. 10.1).

Notice, however, that B has a discontinuity at x = 0, and this signals the presence of a surface current K in the yz plane; boundary condition (iv) in Eq. 7.63 gives kt y = K x x, and hence K = kt z. Evidently we have here a uniform surface current flowing in the z direction over the plane x = 0, which starts up at t = 0, and increases in proportion to t. Notice that the news travels out (in both directions) at the speed of light: for points |x| > ct the message (that current is now flowing) has not yet arrived, so the fields are zero. Problem 10.1 Show that the differential equations for V and A (Eqs. 10.4 and 10.5) can be written in the more symmetrical form D2V+ — = ~-p, at e0 ¡2A - VL = —/z0J.

However, we have succeeded in reducing six problems— finding E and B (three components each)—down to four: V (one component) and A (three more). Moreover, Eqs. 10.2 and 10.3 do not uniquely define the potentials; we are free to impose extra conditions on V and A, as long as nothing happens to E and B. Let’s work out precisely what this gauge freedom entails. Suppose we have two sets of potentials, (V, A) and (V', A'), which correspond to the same electric and magnetic fields. By how much can they differ? Write A' = A + a and V' = V + /3. Since the two A’s give the same B, their curls must be equal, and hence V x a — 0. We can therefore write a as the gradient of some scalar: a = VA. 420 CHAPTER 10. POTENTIALS AND HELDS Conclusion: For any old scalar function A, we can with impunity add V A to A, provided we simultaneously subtract 9A/dt from V. None of this will affect the physical quantities E and B. Such changes in V and A are called gauge transformations. They can be exploited to adjust the divergence of A, with a view to simplifying the “ugly” equations 10.4 and 10.5. In magnetostatics, it was best to choose V • A = 0 (Eq. 5.61); in electrodynamics the situation is not so clear cut, and the most convenient gauge depends to some extent on the problem at hand. There are many famous gauges in the literature; I’ll show you the two most popular ones. Problem 10.3 Find the fields, and the charge and current distributions, corresponding to V(r,O = 0, A(r,f) = — 47T€q r l Problem 10.4 Suppose V = 0 and A = Ao sin(k x — ait) y, where Aq, a>, and k are constants.

THE POTENTIAL FORMULATION 421 10.1.3 Coulomb Gauge and Lorentz* Gauge The Coulomb Gauge. As in magnetostatics, we pick V • A = 0. With this, Eq. 10.4 becomes (10 .8) (10.9) This is Poisson’s equation, and we already know how to solve it: setting V — 0 at infinity, V2V =- p . eo V(r, t) 1 f P(r\\ 4jte0 J n. t) d t' . (10.10) Don’t be fooled, though—unlike electrostatics, V by itself doesn’t tell you E; you have to know A as well (Eq. 10.3). There is a peculiar thing about the scalar potential in the Coulomb gauge: it is determined by the distribution of charge right now. If I move an electron in my laboratory, the potential V on the moon immediately records this change. That sounds particularly odd in the light of special relativity, which allows no message to travel faster than the speed of light. The point is that V by itself is not a physically measurable quantity—all the man in the moon can measure is E, and that involves A as well. Somehow it is built into the vector potential, in the Coulomb gauge, that whereas V instantaneously reflects all changes in p, the combination —W — (3A/31) does not, E will change only after sufficient time has elapsed for the “news” to arrive.1 The advantage of the Coulomb gauge is that the scalar potential is particularly simple to calculate; the disadvantage (apart from the acausal appearance of V) is that A is particularly difficult to calculate. The differential equation for A (10.5) in the Coulomb gauge reads 32A V A - Moeo-^2\" = + MoeoV ^ — The Lorentz gauge. In the Lorentz gauge we pick dv V • A = -po€o dv_ 31 (10.11) (10.12) This is designed to eliminate the middle term in Eq. 10.5 (in the language of Prob. 10.1, it sets L — 0). With this V2A -/roeo^y =-MoJ- (10.13) Meanwhile, the differential equation for V, (10.4), becomes = --p. (10.14) 312 60 There is some question whether this should be attibuted to H. A. Lorentz or to L. V. Lorenz (see J. Van Bladel, IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine 33(2), 69 (1991)). But all the standard textbooks include the t, and to avoid possible confusion I shall adhere to that practice. 1 See O. L. Brill and B. Goodman. Am. J. Phys. 35, 832 (1967). 422 CHAPTER 10. POTENTIALS AND FIELDS The virtue of the Lorentz gauge is that it treats V and A on an equal footing: the same differential operator (10.15) (called the d’Alembertian) occurs in both equations: (10.16) This democratic treatment of V and A is particularly nice in the context of special relativity, where the d’Alembertian is the natural generalization of the Laplacian, and Eqs. 10.16 can be regarded as four-dimensional versions of Poisson’s equation. (In this same spirit the wave equation, for propagation speed c, D2/ = 0, might be regarded as the four-dimensional version of Laplace’s equation.) In the Lorentz gauge V and A satisfy the inhomogeneous wave equation, with a “source” term (in place of zero) on the right. From now on I shall use the Lorentz gauge exclusively, and the whole of electrodynamics reduces to the problem of solving the inhomogeneous wave equation for specified sources. That’s my project for the next section. Problem 10.6 Which of the potentials in Ex. 10.1, Prob. 10.3, andProb. 10.4 are in the Coulomb gauge? Which are in the Lorentz gauge? (Notice that these gauges are not mutually exclusive.) Problem 10.7 In Chapter 5, I showed that it is always possible to pick a vector potential whose divergence is zero (Coulomb gauge). Show that it is always possible to choose V A = —POtoidV/dt), as required for the Lorentz gauge, assuming you know how to solve equations of the form 10.16. Is it always possible to pick V = 0? How about A = 0? 10.2 Continuous Distributions 10.2.1 Retarded Potentials In the static case, Eqs. 10.16 reduce to (four copies of) Poisson’s equation, V 2v =- p , V 2A = —/zoJ, €0 with the familiar solutions 1 t fV) ^ iV.

Now, electromagnetic “news” travels at the speed of light. In the nonstatic case, therefore, it’s not the status of the source right now that matters, but rather its condition at some earlier time tr (called the retarded time) when the “message” left. Since this message must travel a distance 4, the delay is n-jc. (10.18) The natural generalization of Eq. 10.17 for nonstatic sources is therefore V(r, f) — [ etc<Adx' 4jre0 J >i A(r, t) m f 4 it J n, (10.19) Here p(r', tr) is the charge density that prevailed at point r' at the retarded time tr. Because the integrands are evaluated at the retarded time, these are called retarded potentials. (I speak of “the” retarded time, but of course the most distant parts of the charge distribution have earlier retarded times than nearby ones. It’s just like the night sky: The light we see now left each star at the retarded time corresponding to that star’s distance from the earth.) Note that the retarded potentials reduce properly to Eq. 10.17 in the static case, for which p and J are independent of time. Well, that all sounds reasonable—and surprisingly simple. But are we sure it’s right? I didn’t actually derive these formulas for V and A; all I did was invoke a heuristic argument (“electromagnetic news travels at the speed of light”) to make them seem plausible. To prove them, I must show that they satisfy the inhomogeneous wave equation (10.16) and meet the Lorentz condition (10.12). In case you think I’m being fussy, let me warn you that if you apply the same argument to the fields you’ll get entirely the wrong answer: E(r, t) / 4tt€0 J p{r', tr) idi' B(r, t) /TO f j(r', tr) X i d ^ , 4 TV J 4 2 424 CHAPTER 10. POTENTIALS AND FIELDS as you would expect if the same “logic” worked for Coulomb’s law and the Biot-Savart law. Let’s stop and check, then, that the retarded scalar potential satisfies Eq. 10.16; essentially the same argument would serve for the vector potential.2 I shall leave it for you (Prob. 10.8) to check that the retarded potentials obey the Lorentz condition. In calculating the Laplacian of E(r, t), the crucial point to notice is that the integrand (in Eq. 10.19) depends on r in two places: explicitly, in the denominator (4 = |r — r'|), and implicitly, through tr = t - n,/c. in the numerator. Thus VV = —( 4jre0 J (Vp)- + pvf- 4 V 4 dx', (10.20) and Vp = p\\t r = —pV4 c (10.21) (the dot denotes differentiation with respect to time).3 Now V4 = 4 and V(1 / 4) = -i/ 4 2 (Prob. 1.13), so W = — l 4jre0 J p -t 4 - P -y C 4 4Z dx'.

A. Heald and J. B. Marion, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation, 3d ed., Sect. 8.1 (Orlando, FL: Saunders (1995)). 3Note that d/Str = d/dt, since tr = t -tl/c and4 is independent of t. 10.2. CONTINUOUS DISTRIBUTIONS 425 Incidentally, this proof applies equally well to the advanced potentials, v„(r.0 = 2-f dr>, K(r,,} = ^[ h rAdd T', (10.23) 4^e 0 J * 4 it J n, in which the charge and the current densities are evaluated at the advanced time ta= t + ~. (10.24) c A few signs are changed, but the final result is unaffected. Although the advanced potentials are entirely consistent with Maxwell’s equations, they violate the most sacred tenet in all of physics: the principle of causality. They suggest that the potentials now depend on what the charge and the current distribution will be at some time in the future—the effect; in other words, precedes the cause. Although the advanced potentials are of some theoretical interest, they have no direct physical significance.4 Example 10.1 An infinite straight wire carries the current 7(0 = 0, for t < 0, 7q, for t > 0. That is, a constant current 70 is turned on abruptly at t = 0. Find the resulting electric and magnetic fields. Solution: The wire is presumably electrically neutral, so the scalar potential is zero.

Calculate the retarded vector potential A at the center. Find the electric field at the center. Why does this (neutral) wire produce an electric field? (Why can’t you determine the magnetic field from this expression for A?) 10.2.2 Jefimenko’s Equations Given the retarded potentials Ane0 J i 4it J J(r ’,tr) dr', it is, in principle, a straightforward matter to determine the fields: B = V x A. 3A E = -VV-, dt (10.26) (10.27) But the details are not entirely trivial because, as I mentioned earlier, the integrands depend on r both explicitly, through n. = |r — r'| in the denominator, and implicitly, through the retarded time tr — t — ijc in the argument of the numerator. I already calculated the gradient of V (Eq. 10.22); the time derivative of A is easy: 31 An J n.

(10.31) This is the time-dependent generalization of the Biot-Savart law, to which it reduces in the static case. Equations 10.29 and 10.31 are the (causal) solutions to Maxwell’s equations. For some reason they do not seem to have been published until quite recently—the earliest explicit statement of which I am aware was by Oleg Jefimenko, in 1966.5 In practice Jefimenko’s equations are of limited utility, since it is typically easier to calculate the retarded potentials and differentiate them, rather than going directly to the fields. Nevertheless, they provide a satisfying sense of closure to the theory. They also help to clarify an observation I made in the previous section: To get to the retarded potentials, all you do is replace t by /,  in the electrostatic and magnetostatic formulas, but in the case of the fields not only is time replaced by retarded time, but completely new terms (involving derivatives of p and J) appear. And they provide surprisingly strong support for the quasistatic approximation (see Prob. 10.12). 50. D. Jefimenko, Electricity and Magnetism, Sect. 15.7 (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1996). Closely related expressions appear in W. K. H. Panofsky and M. Phillips, Classical Electricity and Magnetism, Sect. 14.3 (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1962). See K. T. McDonald, Am. J. Phys. 65, 1074 (1997) for illuminating commentary and references. 10.3. POINT CHARGES 429 Problem 10.11 Suppose J(r) is constant in time, so (Prob. 7.55) p(r, t ) = p(r, 0) + /)(r. 0)t.

This means that the quasistatic approximation is actually much better than we had any right to expect: the two errors involved (neglecting retardation and dropping the second term in Eq. 10.31) cancel one another, to first order. 10.3 Point Charges 10.3.1 Lienard-Wiechert Potentials My next project is to calculate the (retarded) potentials, V(r, t) and A(r, t). of a point charge q that is moving on a specified trajectory w(t) = position of q at time t. (10.32) The retarded time is determined implicitly by the equation |r — w(tr)| = c(t — tr), (10.33) for the left side is the distance the “news” must travel, and (t — tr) is the time it takes to make the trip (Fig. 10.6). I shall call w(tr) the retarded position of the charge; n. is the vector from the retarded position to the field point r: * = r-w(t r). (10.34) It is important to note that at most one point on the trajectory is “in communication” with r at any particular time t. For suppose there were two such points, with retarded times t\\ and t2\\ >i\\ = c(t — t\\) and n-2 — c(t — t2). 430 CHAPTER 10. POTENTIALS AND FIELDS Retarded Figure 10.6 Then >i\\ — 'to = (-'(to —1\\), so the average velocity of the particle in the direction of r would have to be c—and that’s not counting whatever velocity the charge might have in other directions. Since no charged particle can travel at the speed of light, it follows that only one retarded point contributes to the potentials, at any given moment.6 Now, a naive reading of the formula V(r ,t) —1— [ dr' Ane0 J * (10.35) might suggest to you that the retarded potential of a point charge is simply 1 q Ah€q 't (the same as in the static case, only with the understanding that 't is the distance to the retarded position of the charge). But this is wrong, for a very subtle reason: It is true that for a point source the denominator n, comes outside the integral,7 but what remains, J p(r',tr)d x', (10.361 is not equal to the charge of the particle. To calculate the total charge of a configuration you must integrate p over the entire distribution at one instant of time, but here the retardation. /,- = t —'t/C, obliges us to evaluate p at different times for different parts of the configuration. If the source is moving, this will give a distorted picture of the total charge. You might 6For the same reason, an observer at r sees the particle in only one place at a time. By contrast, it is possible to hear an object in two places at once. Consider a bear who growls at you and then runs toward you at the speed ot sound and growls again; you hear both growls at the same time, coming from two different locations, but there'' only one bear. 7There is, however, an implicit change in its functional dependence: Before the integration, 't = |r — r'| is a function of r and r'; after the integration (which fixes r' = w (tr)')'t = jr — w(fr)| is (like tr) a function of r and; 10.3. POINT CHARGES 431 think that this problem would disappear for point charges, but it doesn’t. In Maxwell’s electrodynamics, formulated as it is in terms of charge and current densities, a point charge must be regarded as the limit of an extended charge, when the size goes to zero. And for an extended particle, no matter how small, the retardation in Eq. 10.36 throws in a factor (1 — i • v/c)- 1, where v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time: f p(r',tr)d x' = --- (10.37) J 1 - 4-   V/C Proof: This is a purely geometrical effect, and it may help to tell the story in a less abstract context. You will not have noticed it, for obvious reasons, but the fact is that a train coming towards you looks a little longer than it really is, because the light you receive from the caboose left earlier than the light you receive simultaneously from the engine, and at that earlier time the train was farther away (Fig. 10.7). In the interval it takes light from the caboose to travel the extra distance L', the train itself moves a distance /. ' — L: L' L’ - L , L — =-, or L —- . C V 1 - v/c So approaching trains appear longer, by a factor (1 — i>/c)- 1. By contrast, a train going away from you looks shorter,8 by a factor (1 + v/c) ~1. In general, if the train’s velocity makes an angle 9 with your line of sight,9 the extra distance light from the caboose must cover is L' cos 9 (Fig. 10.8). In the time L' cos 9/c, then, the train moves a distance (Lf — L): L'c os9 L'— L , L -=-, or L —- . c v 1 — v cos 9/c 8Please note that this has nothing whatever to do with special relativity or Lorentz contraction—L is the length of the moving train, and its rest length is not at issue. The argument is somewhat reminiscent of the Doppler effect. 91 assume the train is far enough away or (more to the point) short enough so that rays from the caboose and engine can be considered parallel. 432 CHAPTER 10. POTENTIALS AND FIELDS L' Figure 10.8 Notice that this effect does not distort the dimensions perpendicular to the motion (the height and width of the train). Never mind that the light from the far side is delayed in reaching you (relative to light from the near side)—since there’s no motion in that direction, they’ll still look the same distance apart. The apparent volume x' of the train, then, is related to the actual volume r by 1 - i   \\/c (10.38) where i is a unit vector from the train to the observer. In case the connection between moving trains and retarded potentials escapes you, the point is this: Whenever you do an integral of the type 10.37, in which the integrand is evaluated at the retarded time, the effective volume is modified by the factor in Eq. 10.38, just as the apparent volume of the train was—and for the same reason. Because this correction factor makes no reference to the size of the particle, it is every bit as significant for a point charge as for an extended charge. qed It follows, then, that V(r,t) 1 qc 4ti€q (4c — • v) ’ (10.39) where v is the velocity of the charge at the retarded time, and n. is the vector from the retarded position to the field point r.

Solution: For convenience, let’s say the particle passes through the origin at time t = 0, so that w(t) = \\t. We first compute the retarded time, using Eq. 10.33: |r — \\t r \\ = c(t-t r) , or, squaring: r2 - 2r • vtr + v2t 2 = c2(t2 - 2ttr + t2). Solving for tT by the quadratic formula, I find that (c2t — r   v) ± y/(c2t - r • v)2 + (c2 - v2)(r2 - c2t 2) (10.41) To fix the sign, consider the limit v = 0: . r tr =t ± - . c In this case the charge is at rest at the origin, and the retarded time should be (t - r/c ); evidently we want the minus sign.

Evidently for nonrelativistic velocities ('v2 « c2), V(r,t ) |_9 4;reo R Figure 10.9 Problem 10.15 I showed that at most one point on the particle trajectory communicates with r at any given time. In some cases there may be no such point (an observer at r would not see the particle—in the colorful language of General Relativity it is “beyond the horizon”). As an example, consider a particle in hyperbolic motion along the x axis: w(r) = & + (Ct)2x (—00 < t < oo). (10.45) 10.3. POINT CHARGES 435 (In Special Relativity this is the trajectory of a particle subject to a constant force F = mc2/b.) Sketch the graph of w versus t. At four or five representative points on the curve, draw the trajectory of a light signal emitted by the particle at that point—both in the plus x direction and in the minus x direction. What region on your graph corresponds to points and times (x, t) from which the particle cannot be seen? At what time does someone at point x first see the particle? (Prior to this the potential at x is evidently zero.) Is it possible for a particle, once seen, to disappear from view? Problem 10.16 Determine the Lienard-Wiechert potentials for a charge in hyperbolic motion (Eq. 10.45). Assume the point r is on the x axis and to the right of the charge. 10.3.2 The Fields of a Moving Point Charge We are now in a position to calculate the electric and magnetic fields of a point charge in arbitrary motion, using the Lienard-Wiechert potentials:11 V(X ,t) 1 qc Ah€q (4C -*-v) A(r, t) = ~V(r,t), cL and the equations for E and B: E = -VV - —, dt B = V x A. The differentiation is tricky, however, because (10.46) * — r — w(fr) and v = w(tr) (10.47) are both evaluated at the retarded time, and tr—defined implicitly by the equation |r - w(/r)| = c(t - tr) (10.48) —is itself a function of r and f.12 So hang on: the next two pages are rough going ... but the answer is worth the effort. Let’s begin with the gradient of V: VV qc -1 47reo (be — *   v)2 V(-iC — -t • v). (10.49) 11 You can get the fields directly from Jefimenko’s equations, but it’s not easy. See, for example, M. A. Heald and J. B. Marion, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation, 3d ed.. Sect. 8.4 (Orlando, FL: Saunders, 1995). 12The following calculation is done by the most direct, “brute force” method. For a more clever and efficient approach see J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3d ed., Sect. 14.1 (New York: John Wiley, 1999). 436 CHAPTER 10.

POINT CHARGES 437 Putting all this back into Eq. 10.51, and using the “BAC-CAB” rule to reduce the triple cross products, V(*-v) = a(> • Vtr) + v - v(v • Vtr) -* x (a x Vfr) + v x (v x Vtr) = v + O • a — v )Vtr.

C AtTCq (U • -4) 3 The quantity in brackets is strikingly similar to the one in Eq. 10.65, which can be written, using the BAC-CAB rule, as [(c2 — u2)u + (-t a)u — (-t u)a]; the main difference is that we have v’s instead of u’s in the first two terms. In fact, since it’s all crossed into -4 anyway, we can with impunity change these v’s into —u’s; the extra term proportional to -4 disappears in the cross product. It follows that 1 „ B(r, t) = --4 x E(r, t). c (10 .66) Evidently the magnetic field of a point charge is always perpendicular to the electric field, and to the vector from the retarded point. The first term in E (the one involving (c2 — u2)u) falls off as the inverse square of the distance from the particle. If the velocity and acceleration are both zero, this term alone survives and reduces to the old electrostatic result 47re0 f 1 For this reason, the first term in E is sometimes called the generalized Coulomb field. (Because it does not depend on the acceleration, it is also known as the velocity field.) The second term (the one involving -4 x (u x a)) falls off as the inverse first power of -4 and is therefore dominant at large distances. As we shall see in Chapter 11, it is this term that is responsible for electromagnetic radiation; accordingly, it is called the radiation field—or. since it is proportional to a, the acceleration field. The same terminology applies to the magnetic field. Back in Chapter 2,1 commented that if we could only write down the formula for the force one charge exerts on another, we would be done with electrodynamics, in principle. That, together with the superposition principle, would tell us the force exerted on a test 10.3. POINT CHARGES 439 charge Q by any configuration whatsoever. Well... here we are: Eqs. 10.65 and 10.66 give us the fields, and the Lorentz force law determines the resulting force: Cf (9 'T- f '•y '•y F = --—- [(c2 - u2)u + * x (u x a)] 47reo (<» • u)J l + ^ x x [(c2 - i>2)u + * x (u x a)]j j, (10.67) where V is the velocity of Q, and -t, u, v, and a are all evaluated at the retarded time. The entire theory of classical electrodynamics is contained in that equation ... but you see why I preferred to start out with Coulomb’s law.

In Ex. 10.3 we found that 'tc — -t-v = 't-u = y (c2f — r • v)2 + (c2 — i>2)(r 2 — c2f2). In Prob. 10.14, you showed that this radical could be written as RciJ 1 — u2 sin2 0/c 2, where R = r — v/ is the vector from the present location of the particle to r, and 6 is the angle between R and v (Fig. 10.9).

This is an extraordinary coincidence, since the “message” came from the retarded position. Because of the sin2 9 in the denominator, the field of a fast-moving charge is flattened out like a pancake in the direction perpendicular to the motion (Fig. 10.10). In the forward and backward directions E is reduced by a factor (1 — u2/c 2) relative to the field of a charge at rest; in the perpendicular direction it is enhanced by a factor 1 /y/\\ — u2/c 2. 440 CHAPTER 10.

Phys. 43, 258 (1975). Chapter 11 Radiation 11.1 Dipole Radiation 11.1.1 What is Radiation? In Chapter 9 we discussed the propagation of plane electromagnetic waves through various media, but I did not tell you how the waves got started in the first place. Like all electro¬ magnetic fields, their source is some arrangement of electric charge. But a charge at rest does not generate electromagnetic waves; nor does a steady current. It takes accelerating charges, and changing currents, as we shall see. My purpose in this chapter is to show you how such configurations produce electromagnetic waves—that is, how they radiate. Once established, electromagnetic waves in vacuum propagate out “to infinity,” carrying energy with them; the signature of radiation is this irreversible flow of energy away from the source. Throughout this chapter I shall assume the source is localized1 near the origin. Imagine a gigantic spherical shell, out at radius r (Fig. 11.1); the total power passing out through this surface is the integral of the Poynting vector: P{r) = j)Sd&= — ^ (ExB)-da. (11-1) The power radiated is the limit of this quantity as r goes to infinity: Prad = lim P{r). (11.2) r-*oo This is the energy (per unit time) that is transported out to infinity, and never comes back. Now, the area of the sphere is 4itr2, so for radiation to occur the Poynting vector must decrease (at large r) no faster than 1 /r 2 (if it went like 1 /r 3, for example, then P(r) would go like 1/r, and Pra<i would be zero). According to Coulomb’s law, electro static fields fall off like 1 /r 2 (or even faster, if the total charge is zero), and the Biot-Savart law says 1 For nonlocalized sources, such as infinite planes, wires, or solenoids, the whole concept of “radiation” must be reformulated—see Prob. 11.24. 3 444 CHAPTER 11. RADIATION Figure 11.1 that magnetostatic fields go like 1/r2 (or faster), which means that S ~ 1/r4, for static configurations. So static sources do not radiate. But Jefimenko’s equations (10.29 and 10.31) indicate that time-dependent fields include terms (involving p and j) that go like 1/r; it is these terms that are responsible for electromagnetic radiation. The study of radiation, then, involves picking out the parts of E and B that go like 1/r at large distances from the source, constructing from them the 1 /r 2 term in S, integrating over a large spherical2 surface, and taking the limit as r ->   oo. I’ll carry through this procedure first for oscillating electric and magnetic dipoles; then, in Sect. 11.2, we’ll consider the more difficult case of radiation from an accelerating point charge. 11.1.2 Electric Dipole Radiation Picture two tiny metal spheres separated by a distance d and connected by a fine wire (Fig. 11.2); at time t the charge on the upper sphere is q(t), and the charge on the lower sphere is -q(t). Suppose that we drive the charge back and forth through the wire, from one end to the other, at an angular frequency or. q(t) = q0c os(wt). (11.3) The result is an oscillating electric dipole:3 p(i) = po cos(mt) z, (11.4) where Po = qod is the the maximum value of the dipole moment. 2It doesn’t have to be a sphere, of course, but this makes the calculations a lot easier. 3 It might occur to you that a more natural model would consist of equal and opposite charges mounted on a spring, say, so that q is constant while d oscillates, instead of the other way around. Such a model would lead to the same result, but there is a subtle problem in calculating the retarded potentials of a moving point charge, which I would prefer to save for Sect. 11.2. 11.1. DIPOLE RADIATION 445 Figure 11.2 The retarded potential (Eq. 10.19) is V(r ,t) = 1 | qo cos[ft)(t — >i+/c)] q$ cos[m(t — n,-/c)] where, by the law of cosines, — Jr 2 ^prd cos 0 + (d/2)2. Now, to make this physical dipole into a perfect dipole, we want the separation distance to be extremely small: approximation 1: d«r. (11.7) Of course, if d is zero we get no potential at all; what we want is an expansion carried to first order in d. Thus It follows that n-± = r (It — cos 0 \\ 2r 1 _ 1 / , d — = - [ 1 ± — cos 0 >t± r \\ 2r cos[m(t — -2-i/c)] = cos co(t — r/c) ± — COS0 L 2c = cos[ft)(t - r/c)] cos cos 0J sin[m(t - r/c)] sin cos6» In the perfect dipole limit we have, further, approximation 2: d <«C —.

RADIATION Equations 11.18 and 11.19 represent monochromatic waves of frequency &> traveling in the radial direction at the speed of light. E and B are in phase, mutually perpendicular, and transverse; the ratio of their amplitudes is Ep/Bp = c. All of which is precisely what we expect for electromagnetic waves in free space. (These are actually spherical waves, not plane waves, and their amplitude decreases like 1 /r as they progress. But for large r, they are approximately plane over small regions—just as the surface of the earth is reasonably flat, locally.)

The total power radiated is found by integrating (S) over a sphere of radius r: (P ) -I (S) • da — 2 4 riOPpM 32:t 2 c fS 1 sin2 6 -r2 sin 8 dd d(p riQPpm4 I2nc (11.22) Figure 11.4 5The “radial” coordinate in Fig. 11.4 represents the magnitude of (S) (at fixed r), as a function of 9 and 4>- 11.1. DIPOLE RADIATION 449 It is independent of the radius of the sphere, as one would expect from conservation of energy (with approximation 3 we were anticipating the limit r -> oo). Example 11.1 The sharp frequency dependence of the power formula is what accounts for the blueness of the sky. Sunlight passing through the atmosphere stimulates atoms to oscillate as tiny dipoles. The incident solar radiation covers a broad range of frequencies (white light), but the energy absorbed and reradiated by the atmospheric dipoles is stronger at the higher frequencies because of the £i>4 in Eq. 11.22. It is more intense in the blue, then, than in the red. It is this reradiated light that you see when you look up in the sky—unless, of course, you’re staring directly at the sun. Because electromagnetic waves are transverse, the dipoles oscillate in a plane orthogonal to the sun’s rays. In the celestial arc perpendicular to these rays, where the blueness is most pronounced, the dipoles oscillating along the line of sight send no radiation to the observer (because of the sin2 9 in equation Eq. 11.21); light received at this angle is therefore polarized perpendicular to the sun’s rays (Fig. 11.5). Figure 11.5 The redness of sunset is the other side of the same coin: Sunlight coming in at a tangent to the earth’s surface must pass through a much longer stretch of atmosphere than sunlight coming from overhead (Fig. 11.6). Accordingly, much of the blue has been removed by scattering and what’s left is red. Problem 11.1 Check that the retarded potentials of an oscillating dipole (Eqs. 11.12 and 11.17) satisfy the Lorentz gauge condition. Do not use approximation 3. Problem 11.2 Equation 11.14 can be expressed in “coordinate-free” form by writing po cos 0 = PO   r. Do so, and likewise for Eqs. 11.17, 11.18. 11.19, and 11.21. 450 CHAPTER 11. RADIATION Atmosphere (thickness grossly exaggerated) \" Sun's rays Figure 11.6 Problem 11.3 Find the radiation resistance of the wire joining the two ends of the dipole. (This is the resistance that would give the same average power loss—to heat—as the oscillating dipole in fact puts out in the form of radiation.) Show that R = 790 (d/k)2 Q. where k is the wavelength of the radiation. For the wires in an ordinary radio (say, d = 5 cm), should you worry about the radiative contribution to the total resistance? Figure 11.7 Problem 11.4 A rotating electric dipole can be thought of as the superposition of two oscillating dipoles, one along the x axis, and the other along the y axis (Fig. 11.7), with the latter out of phase by 90°: p = /ro[cos(w0 * + sin (tut) y]. Using the principle of superposition and Eqs. 11.18 and 11.19 (perhaps in the form suggested by Prob. 11.2), find the fields of a rotating dipole. Also find the Poynting vector and the intensity of the radiation. Sketch the intensity profile as a function of the polar angle 6, and calculate the total power radiated. Does the answer seem reasonable? (Note that power, being quadratic in the fields, does not satisfy the superposition principle. In this instance, however, it seems to. Can you account for this?) 11.1. DIPOLE RADIATION 451 11.1.3 Magnetic Dipole Radiation Suppose now that we have a wire loop of radius b (Fig. 11.8), around which we drive an alternating current: l{t) = 70c os(&>t). (11.23) This is a model for an oscillating magnetic dipole, m(t) = nb 2I (t)z = mocos(&>f)z, (11.24) where m o = jt b2I 0 (11.25) is the maximum value of the magnetic dipole moment. The loop is uncharged, so the scalar potential is zero. The retarded vector potential is A(r, t) MO f /QCOS[ft>(f - Vc)] , An J i (11.26) For a point r directly above the x axis (Fig. 11.8), A must aim in the y direction, since the x components from symmetrically placed points on either side of the x axis will cancel.

They are, in fact, remarkably similar in structure to the fields of an oscillating electric dipole (Eqs. 11.18 and 11.19), only this time it is B that points in the 8 direction and E in the 0 direction, whereas for electric dipoles it’s the other way around.

Compare Eqs. 11.36 and 11.37, and comment on the result. 11.1.4 Radiation from an Arbitrary Source In the previous sections we studied the radiation produced by two specific systems: os¬ cillating electric dipoles and oscillating magnetic dipoles. Now I want to apply the same procedures to a configuration of charge and current that is entirely arbitrary, except that it is localized within some finite volume near the origin (Fig. 11.9). The retarded scalar potential is V(r,t) p(r',t-'t/c) , , - a t (11.43) 11.1. DIPOLE RADIATION 455 Figure 11.9 where n. = Jr 2 + r'2 - 2r • r'. (11.44) As before, we shall assume that the field point r is far away, in comparison to the dimensions of the source: approximation 1 : r' r. (11.45) (Actually, r’ is a variable of integration; approximation 1 means that the maximum value of r', as it ranges over the source, is much less than r.) On this assumption, n. = r 1 — r • r' so l- = '-(i + r r and . ( , r r r' p(r , t - n./c) = p ( r , t- 1- \\ c c Expanding p as a Taylor series in t about the retarded time at the origin, r to = t - -, (11.46) (11.47) (11.48) we have p(r', t - i/c) = p{r', t0) + p{r', to) r • r + (11.49) where the dot signifies differentiation with respect to time. The next terms in the series would be 1.. /f-r'\\ 2 1 /r-r'\\ 3 456 CHAPTER 11.

In the general case it’s more difficult to interpret Eq. 11.50, but as a procedural matter approximations 1 and 2 amount to keeping only the first-order terms in r'. Putting Eqs. 11.47 and 11.49 into the formula for V (Eq. 11.43), and again discarding the second-order term: V(r > t) = ——-— f p(r\\ t0) dx' + - • f r'p(r', to) dr' + - • -j- f r'p(r', t0) dr' 4ne0r U r J c dt J The first integral is simply the total charge, Q, at time to. Because charge is conserved, however, Q is actually independent of time. The other two integrals represent the electric dipole moment at time to- Thus V(r, t) = 4neo Q r-p(to) r-p(to) \"T O “T rc (11.51) In the static case, the first two terms are the monopole and dipole contributions to the multipole expansion for V; the third term, of course, would not be present. Meanwhile, the vector potential is A(r, t) /ro f J(r',t-i/c) , 4 7T ) I (11.52) As you’ll see in a moment, to first order in r' it suffices to replace by r in the integrand: A(r, t) = ^~ [ J(r', to) dr'.

Next we must calculate the fields. Once again, we are interested in the radiation zone (that is, in the fields that survive at large distances from the source), so we keep only those terms that go like 1/r: approximation 3 : discard 1 /r 2 terms in E and B. (11.55) For instance, the Coulomb field, 1 Q . 11.1. DIPOLE RADIATION 457 coming from the first term in Eq. 11.51, does not contribute to the electromagnetic radiation. In fact, the radiation comes entirely from those terms in which we differentiate the argument to- From Eq. 11.48 it follows that and hence Vto = —Vr = —-f, c c VV = V -1 5; o' _i ~ i ’r-p(to)' [47T6o rc 4^-eo rC Vto = 1 [f • p(to)] - -r. 4;reoc2 Similarly, v x A = x P(?o)l = x p(t0)] = x i»(fo)], while 9A ^ n o p(t0) 31 4 n r So E(r, t) = -^-[(r • p)r - p] = -t—[y x (r x p)], where p is evaluated at time to = t — r/c, and (11.56) B(r, 0 = — Mo 4:r rc [f x p].

(b) For a single point charge q, the dipole moment is P(0 = ?d(f), where d is the position of q with respect to the origin. Accordingly, p(f) = ?a(f). where a is the acceleration of the charge. In this case the power radiated (Eq. 11.60) is 2 2 M04a 6jrc (11.61) This is the famous Larmor formula; I’ll derive it again, by rather different means, in the next section. Notice that the power radiated by a point charge is proportional to the square of its acceleration. What I have done in this section amounts to a multipole expansion of the retarded potentials, carried to the lowest order in r' that is capable of producing electromagnetic radiation (fields that go like 1/r). This turns out to be the electric dipole term. Because charge is conserved, an electric monopole does not radiate—if charge were not conserved, the first term in Eq. 11.51 would read T/ 1 QUo) Mnono — , i 4tt€q r and we would get a monopole field proportional to 1/r; E mono 1 fi(fo) « -r 4:reoc r You might think that a charged sphere whose radius oscillates in and out would radiate, but it doesn’t—the field outside, according to Gauss’s law, is exactly (Q/4jreor2)r, regardless of the fluctuations in size. (In the acoustical analog, by the way, monopoles do radiate: witness the croak of a bullfrog.) If the electric dipole moment should happen to vanish (or, at any rate, if its second time derivative is zero), then there is no electric dipole radiation, and one must look to the next term: the one of second order in r'. As it happens, this term can be separated into two parts, one of which is related to the magnetic dipole moment of the source, the other to its electric quadrupole moment. (The former is a generalization of the magnetic dipole radiation we considered in Sect. 11.1.3.) If the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions vanish, the (r'y' term must be considered. This yields magnetic quadrupole and electric octopole radiation ... and so it goes. 11.1.

Problem 11.9 An insulating circular ring (radius b) lies in the xy plane, centered at the origin. It carries a linear charge density X = Xq sin <p, where Xq is constant and <p is the usual azimuthal angle. The ring is now set spinning at a constant angular velocity w about the z axis. Calculate the power radiated. Problem 11.10 An electron is released from rest and falls under the influence of gravity. In the first centimeter, what fraction of the potential energy lost is radiated away?

RADIATION 11.2 Point Charges 11.2.1 Power Radiated by a Point Charge In Chapter 10 we derived the fields of a point charge q in arbitrary motion (Eqs. 10.65 and 10.66): E(r, t) = —^— -———r[(c2 - n2)u +* x (u x a)], (11.62) 4jteo (*   u)J where u = ci — v, and B(r,t)='ixE(r,t). (11.63) The first term in Eq. 11.62 is called the velocity field, and the second one (with the triple cross-product) is called the acceleration field. The Poynting vector is 1 1 1 - S = —(E x B) =-[E x (* x E)] =- [E 2i - (i • E)E], (11.64) Mo Mo c Moc However, not all of this energy flux constitutes radiation; some of it is just field energy carried along by the particle as it moves. The radiated energy is the stuff that, in effect, detaches itself from the charge and propagates off to infinity. (It’s like flies breeding on a garbage truck: Some of them hover around the truck as it makes its rounds; others fly away and never come back.) To calculate the total power radiated by the particle at time tr, we draw a huge sphere of radius n- (Fig. 11.11), centered at the position of the particle (at time tr), wait the appropriate interval t-t r = - (11.65) c for the radiation to reach the sphere, and at that moment integrate the Poynting vector over the surface.6 I have used the notation tr because, in fact, this is the retarded time for all points on the sphere at time t. Now, the area of the sphere is proportional to r 2, so any term in S that goes like 1/-M will yield a finite answer, but terms like l/'t? or l/^ 4 will contribute nothing in the limit i' —> oo. For this reason only the acceleration fields represent true radiation (hence their other name, radiation fields): Erad = - N -t x (u X a)]. (11.66) 4;reo (* • u)J 6Note the subtle change in strategy here: In Sect. 11.1 we worked from a fixed point (the origin), but here it is more appropriate to use the (moving) location of the charge. The implications of this change in perspective will become clearer in a moment. 11.2. POINT CHARGES 461 Figure 11.11 The velocity fields carry energy, to be sure, and as the charge moves this energy is dragged along—but it’s not radiation.

Although I derived them on the assumption that v = 0, Eqs. 11.69 and 11.70 actually hold to good approximation as long as v <<C c. An exact treatment of the case v ^ 0 is more difficult,7 both for the obvious reason that E rad is more complicated, and also for the more subtle reason that Srad, the rate at which energy passes through the sphere, is not the same as the rate at which energy left the particle. Suppose someone is firing a stream of bullets out the window of a moving car (Fig. 11.13). The rate N t at which the bullets strike a stationary target is not the same as the rate N g at which they left the gun, because of the motion of the car. In fact, you can easily check that N g = (1 —v/c)N t, if the car is moving towards the target, and for arbitrary directions (here v is the velocity of the car, c is that of the bullets—relative to the ground—and i is a unit vector from car to target). In our case, if dW/dt is the rate at which energy passes through the sphere at radius  &, then the rate at which energy left the charge was dW dW/dt /•» • u\\ dW -=-— = (-)-.

If you can decide how P transforms, you can deduce the general (Lienard) result from the v = 0 (Larmor) formula (see Prob. 12.69). 11.2. POINT CHARGES 463 (I usedEq. 10.71 to express dtr/ dt.) But -t • u -tv fyc c which is precisely the ratio of N g to N t; it’s a purely geometrical factor (the same as in the Doppler effect).

This is Lienard’s generalization of the Larmor formula (to which it reduces when v « c). The factor y6 means that the radiated power increases enormously as the particle velocity approaches the speed of light. Example 11.3 Suppose v and a are instantaneously collinear (at time /, ). as, for example, in straight-line motion. Find the angular distribution of the radiation (Eq. 11.72) and the total power emitted.

However, for very large v {fi » 1) the donut of radiation (Fig. 11.12) is stretched out and pushed forward by the factor (1 - cos 0)~5, as indicated in Fig. 11.14. Although there is still no radiation in precisely the forward direction, most of it is concentrated within an increasingly narrow cone about the forward direction (see Prob. 11.15). 464 CHAPTER 11.

Notice that the angular distribution of the radiation is the same whether the particle is accel¬ erating or decelerating; it only depends on the square of a, and is concentrated in the forward direction (with respect to the velocity) in either case. When a high speed electron hits a metal target it rapidly decelerates, giving off what is called bremsstrahlung, or “braking radiation.\" What I have described in this example is essentially the classical theory of bremsstrahlung. Problem 11.13 (a) Suppose an electron decelerated at a constant rate a from some initial velocity vq down to zero. What fraction of its initial kinetic energy is lost to radiation? (The rest is absorbed by whatever mechanism keeps the acceleration constant.) Assume vq <5C c so that the Larmor formula can be used. (b) To get a sense of the numbers involved, suppose the initial velocity is thermal (around Kb1 m/s) and the distance the electron goes is 30 X. What can you conclude about radiation losses for the electrons in an ordinary conductor?

The most important application of these formulas is to circular motion—in this case the radiation is called synchrotron radiation. For a relativistic electron the radiation sweeps around like a locomotive’s headlight as the particle moves.] 11.2.2 Radiation Reaction According to the laws of classical electrodynamics, an accelerating charge radiates. This radiation carries off energy, which must come at the expense of the particle’s kinetic energy. Under the influence of a given force, therefore, a charged particle accelerates less than a neutral one of the same mass. The radiation evidently exerts a force (Frac|) back on the charge—a recoil force, rather like that of a bullet on a gun. In this section we’ll derive the 466 CHAPTER 11. RADIATION radiation reaction force from conservation of energy. Then in the next section I’ll show you the actual mechanism responsible, and derive the reaction force again in the context of a simple model. For a nonrelativistic particle (v 4C c) the total power radiated is given by the Larmor formula (Eq. 11.70): P = 2 2 MOq a 6nc (11.76) Conservation of energy suggests that this is also the rate at which the particle loses energy, under the influence of the radiation reaction force F rac]: Frad ' V = 2 2 MOq a 6nc (11.77) I say “suggests” advisedly, because this equation is actually wrong. For we calculated the radiated power by integrating the Poynting vector over a sphere of “infinite” radius; in this calculation the velocity fields played no part, since they fall off too rapidly as a function of n, to make any contribution. But the velocity fields do carry energy—they just don’t transport it out to infinity. As the particle accelerates and decelerates energy is exchanged between it and the velocity fields, at the same time as energy is irretrievably radiated away by the acceleration fields. Equation 11.77 accounts only for the latter, but if we want to know the recoil force exerted by the fields on the charge, we need to consider the total power lost at any instant, not just the portion that eventually escapes in the form of radiation. (The term “radiation reaction” is a misnomer. We should really call it the field reaction. In fact, we’ll soon see that Fra(j is determined by the time derivative of the acceleration and can be nonzero even when the acceleration itself is instantaneously zero, so that the particle is not radiating.) The energy lost by the particle in any given time interval, then, must equal the energy carried away by the radiation plus whatever extra energy has been pumped into the velocity fields.8 However, if we agree to consider only intervals over which the system returns to its initial state, then the energy in the velocity fields is the same at both ends, and the only net loss is in the form of radiation. Thus Eq. 11.77, while incorrect instantaneously, is valid on the average: f F rad -\\dt — —l y )‘l f a2d t, (11.78) Jtx 07TC Jt] with the stipulation that the state of the system is identical at t\\ and t2- In the case of periodic motion, for instance, we must integrate over an integral number of full cycles.9 Now, the °Actually, while the total field is the sum of velocity and acceleration fields, E = E„ + E fl, the energy is proportional to E 2 = E^ + 2E V   E a + E 2 and contains three terms: energy stored in the velocity fields alone (E 2), energy radiated away (E 2), and a cross term E„   E a. For the sake of simplicity, I’m referring to the combination (E 2 + 2E„   E a) as “energy stored in the velocity fields.” These terms go like 1/-7-4 and 1 /'f. respectively, so neither one contributes to the radiation. ®For nonperiodic motion the condition that the energy in the velocity fields be the same at t\\ and ty is more difficult to achieve. It is not enough that the instantaneous velocities and accelerations be equal, since the fields farther out depend on v and a at earlier times. In principle, then, v and a and all higher derivatives must be identical at t\\ and ?2   In practice, since the velocity fields fall off rapidly with -7-, it is sufficient that v and a be the same over a brief interval prior to t\\ and t2- 11.2. POINT CHARGES 467 right side of Eq. 11.78 can be integrated by parts: The boundary term drops out, since the velocities and accelerations are identical at t\\ and t2, so Eq. 11.78 can be written equivalently as f Jt\\ Frad - ^-a ) • vdt = 0. one Equation 11.79 will certainly be satisfied if Frad = moq2. 6nc 3 (11.79) (11.80) This is the Abraham-Lorentz formula for the radiation reaction force. Of course, Eq. 11.79 doesn’t prove Eq. 11.80. It tells you nothing whatever about the component of F ra d perpendicular to v; and it only tells you the time average of the parallel component—the average, moreover, over very special time intervals. As we’ll see in the next section, there are other reasons for believing in the Abraham-Lorentz formula, but for now the best that can be said is that it represents the simplest form the radiation reaction force could take, consistent with conservation of energy. The Abraham-Lorentz formula has disturbing implications, which are not entirely un¬ derstood nearly a century after the law was first proposed. For suppose a particle is subject to no external forces; then Newton’s second law says Frad MO?2 . —- a = ma, one from which it follows that a(t) = aoe^T where = Mo q2 6nmc (11.81) (11.82) (In the case of the electron, r = 6 x 10-24s.) The acceleration spontaneously increases exponentially with time! This absurd conclusion can be avoided if we insist that ao = 0, but it turns out that the systematic exclusion of such runaway solutions has an even more unpleasant consequence: If you do apply an external force, the particle starts to respond before the force acts! (See Prob. 11.19.) This acausal preacceleration jumps the gun by only a short time r; nevertheless, it is (to my mind) philosophically repugnant that the theory should countenance it at all.10 10These difficulties persist in the relativistic version of the Abraham-Lorentz equation, which can be derived by starting with Lienard’s formula instead of Larmor’s (see Prob. 12.70). Perhaps they are telling us that there can be no such thing as a point charge in classical electrodynamics, or maybe they presage the onset of quantum mechanics. For guides to the literature see Philip Pearle's chapter in D. Teplitz, ed., Electromagnetism: Paths to Research (New York: Plenum. 1982) and F. Rohrlich, Am. J. Phys. 65. 1051 (1997). 468 CHAPTER 11. RADIATION Example 11.4 Calculate the radiation damping of a charged particle attached to a spring of natural frequency coo, driven at frequency co. Solution: The equation of motion is m'x = Spring + ^rad + ^driving = —mco^x + mix + ^driving- With the system oscillating at frequency co, x(t) = xq cos (cot + <5), so —Cl? x. Therefore mx + my x + mco^x = ^driving’ and the damping factor y is given by y = co2 T. (11.83) (11.84) [When I wrote ^damping = —ymv, back in Chap. 9 (Eq. 9.152), I assumed for simplicity that the damping was proportional to the velocity. We now know that radiation damping, at least, is proportional to v. But it hardly matters: for sinusoidal oscillations any even number of derivatives of v would do, since they’re all proportional to i\\] Problem 11.17 (a) A particle of charge q moves in a circle of radius R at a constant speed v. To sustain the motion, you must, of course, provide a centripetal force mv2/R\\ what additional force (Fe) must you exert, in order to counteract the radiation reaction? [It’s easiest to express the answer in terms of the instantaneous velocity v.] What power (P e) does this extra force deliver? Compare P e with the power radiated (use the Larmor formula). (b) Repeat part (a) for a particle in simple harmonic motion with amplitude A and angular frequency co (w(/) = A cos(cot) z). Explain the discrepancy. (c) Consider the case of a particle in free fall (constant acceleration g). What is the radiation reaction force? What is the power radiated? Comment on these results. Problem 11.18 (a) Assuming (implausibly) that y is entirely attributable to radiation damping (Eq. 11.84), show that for optical dispersion the damping is “small” (y coq). Assume that the relevant resonances lie in or near the optical frequency range. (b) Using your results from Prob. 9.24, estimate the width of the anomalous dispersion region, for the model in Prob. 9.23. 11.2. POINT CHARGES 469 ! Problem 11.19 With the inclusion of the radiation reaction force (Eq. 11.80), Newton’s second law for a charged particle becomes . F a = ra H-, m where F is the external force acting on the particle. (a) I n contrast to the case of an uncharged particle (a = F/m ), acceleration (like position and velocity) must now be a continuous function of time, even if the force changes abruptly. (Physically, the radiation reaction damps out any rapid change in a.) Prove that a is continuous at any time t, by integrating the equation of motion above from (t — e) to (t + e) and taking the limit e —»• 0. (b) A particle is subjected to a constant force F, beginning at time t = 0 and lasting until time T. Find the most general solution a(t) to the equation of motion in each of the three periods: (i) t <0; (ii) 0 < t < T; (iii) t > T. (c) Impose the continuity condition (a) at t = 0 and t = T. Show that you can either eliminate the runaway in region (iii) or avoid preacceleration in region (i), but not both. (d) If you choose to eliminate the runaway, what is the acceleration as a function of time, in each interval? How about the velocity? (The latter must, of course, be continuous at t = 0 and t = T.) Assume the particle was originally at rest: v(—oo) = 0. (e) Plot a (t) and v(t), both for an uncharged particle and for a (nonrunaway) charged particle, subject to this force. 11.2.3 The Physical Basis of the Radiation Reaction In the last section I derived the Abraham-Lorentz formula for the radiation reaction, using conservation of energy. I made no attempt to identify the actual mechanism responsible for this force, except to point out that it must be a recoil effect of the particle’s own fields acting back on the charge. Unfortunately, the fields of a point charge blow up right at the particle, so it’s hard to see how one can calculate the force they exert.11 Let’s avoid this problem by considering an extended charge distribution, for which the field is finite everywhere; at the end, we’ll take the limit as the size of the charge goes to zero. In general, the electromagnetic force of one part (A) on another part (B) is not equal and opposite to the force of B on A (Fig. 11.17). If the distribution is divided up into infinitesimal chunks, and the imbalances are added up for all such pairs, the result is a net force of the charge on itself. It is this self-force, resulting from the breakdown of Newton’s third law within the structure of the particle, that accounts for the radiation reaction. Lorentz originally calculated the electromagnetic self-force using a spherical charge distribution, which seems reasonable but makes the mathematics rather cumbersome.12 Because I am only trying to elucidate the mechanism involved, I shall use a less realistic model: a “dumbbell” in which the total charge q is divided into two halves separated by n I t can be done by a suitable averaging of the field, but it’s not easy. See T. H. Boyer, Am. J. Phys. 40, 1843 (1972), and references cited there. ^See J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd ed., Sect. 16.3 (New York: John Wiley, 1999). 470 CHAPTER 11. RADIATION Retarded Present position x(tr) position x(tr) Figure 11.17 Figure 11.18 a fixed distance d (Fig. 11.18). This is the simplest possible arrangement of the charge that permits the essential mechanism (imbalance of internal electromagnetic forces) to function. Never mind that it’s an unlikely model for an elementary particle: in the point limit (d —>  0) any model must yield the Abraham-Lorentz formula, to the extent that conservation of energy alone dictates that answer. Let’s assume the dumbbell moves in the a: direction, and is (instantaneously) at rest at the retarded time. The electric field at (1) due to (2) is (Eq. 10.65), where so that Ei 4 = ~a- 7-[(c 2 + 'fc • a)u - (-»• u)a] 4jl€o (* • u)-5 u = ci and b = lx + d y, u = m, 4 • a = la, and i = y/l2 + d2. (11.85) (11.86) (11.87) Actually, we’re only interested in the x component of Ej, since the y components will cancel when we add the forces on the two ends (for the same reason, we don’t need to worry about the magnetic forces). Now UX cl SI (11.88) and hence q (Ic2 — ad 2) &7T€oC2 (l2 + d 2) 2!2 (11.89) By symmetry, /A, = E\\t , so the net force on the dumbbell is Fself — |(e 1+ e 2) = q2 (Ic 2 — ad 2) „ 87reoc 2 (l2 + d 2) 2/ 2 (11.90) 11.2.

Using Taylor’s theorem 1 ,1 , x{t) = x(tr) + x(tr)(t - tr) + -x(tr)(t - try + -x(t r)(t - try h— , we have, 1, 1 , Z = x(t) - x(tr) = -aT 2 + -aT 3 + • • •, (11-91) 2 6 where T = t — tr, for short.

In effect, the total inertia of the charged dumbbell is m = 2niQ + i q2 Ane® 4dc2 (11.97) where mo is the mass of either end alone. In the context of special relativity it is not surprising that the electrical repulsion of the charges should enhance the mass of the dumbbell. For the potential energy of this configuration (in the static case) is 1 (<?/2)2 4tt€o d (11.98) and according to Einstein’s formula E = me2, this energy contributes to the inertia of the object.14 The second term in Eq. 11.96 is the radiation reaction: pint _ l1Off d rad_ line (11.99) It alone (apart from the mass correction15) survives in the “point dumbbell” limit d ->• 0. Unfortunately, it differs from the Abraham-Lorentz formula by a factor of 2. But then, this is only the self-force associated with the interaction between 1 and 2—hence, the superscript “int.” There remains the force of each end on itself. When the latter is included (see Prob. 11.20) the result is Erad = ^, (11.100) one reproducing the Abraham-Lorentz formula exactly. Conclusion: The radiation reaction is due to the force of the charge on itself—or, more elaborately, the net force exerted by the fields generated by different parts of the charge distribution acting on one another. 14The fact that the numbers work out perfectly is a lucky feature of this configuration. If you do the same calculation for the dumbbell in longitudinal motion, the mass correction is only half of what it “should” be (there’s a 2, instead of a 4, in Eq. 11.97), and for a sphere it’s off by a factor of 3/4. This notorious paradox has been the subject of much debate over the years. See D. J. Griffiths and R. E. Owen, Am. J. Phys. 51, 1120 (1983). 15O f course, the limit d -+ 0 has an embarrassing effect on the mass term. In a sense, it doesn’t matter, since only the total mass m is observable; maybe mg somehow has a compensating (negative!) infinity, so that m comes out finite. This awkward problem persists in quantum electrodynamics, where it is “swept under the rug” in a process known as mass renormalization. 11.2.

(b) Method (a) has the defect that it uses the Abraham-Lorentz formula—the very thing that we were trying to derive. To avoid this, smear out the charge along a strip of length L oriented perpendicular to the motion (the charge density, then, is X = q/L)\\ find the cumulative interaction force for all pairs of segments, using Eq. 11.99 (with the correspondence q/2 —>  X dy\\, at one end and q/2 —»• X dyi at the other).

Teplitz (New York: Plenum Press, 1982).] Chapter 12 Electrodynamics and Relativity 12.1 The Special Theory of Relativity 12.1.1 Einstein’s Postulates Classical mechanics obeys the principle of relativity: the same laws apply in any inertial reference frame. By “inertial” I mean that the system is at rest or moving with constant velocity.1 Imagine, for example, that you have loaded a billiard table onto a railroad car, and the train is going at constant speed down a smooth straight track. The game would proceed exactly the same as it would if the train were parked in the station; you don’t have to “correct” your shots for the fact that the train is moving—indeed, if you pulled all the curtains you would have no way of knowing whether the train was moving or not. Notice by contrast that you would know it immediately if the train sped up, or slowed down, or turned a comer, or went over a bump—the billiard balls would roll in weird curved trajectories, and you yourself would feel a lurch. The laws of mechanics, then, are certainly not the same in accelerating reference frames. In its application to classical mechanics, the principle of relativity is hardly new; it was stated clearly by Galileo. Question: does it also apply to the laws of electrodynamics? At first glance the answer would seem to be no. After all, a charge in motion produces a magnetic field, whereas a charge at rest does not. A charge carried along by the train would generate a magnetic field, but someone on the train, applying the laws of electrodynamics 'This raises an awkward problem: Ifthelawsof physics hold just as well in a uniformly moving frame, then we have no way of identifying the “rest” frame in the first place, and hence no way of checking that some other frame is moving at constant velocity. To avoid this trap we define an inertial frame formally as one in which Newton's first law holds. If you want to know whether you’re in an inertial frame, throw some rocks around—if they travel in straight lines at constant speed, you’ve got yourself an inertial frame, and any frame moving at constant velocity with respect to you will be another inertial frame (see Prob. 12.1). 477 478 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Wire loop in that system, would predict no magnetic field. In fact, many of the equations of elec¬ trodynamics, starting with the Lorentz force law, make explicit reference to “the” velocity of the charge. It certainly appears, therefore, that electromagnetic theory presupposes the existence of a unique stationary reference frame, with respect to which all velocities are to be measured. And yet there is an extraordinary coincidence that gives us pause. Suppose we mount a wire loop on a freight car, and have the train pass between the poles of a giant magnet (Fig. 12.1). As the loop rides through the magnetic field, a motional emf is established; according to the flux rule (Eq. 7.13), e = - d -±. dt This emf, remember, is due to the magnetic force on charges in the wire loop, which are moving along with the train. On the other hand, if someone on the train naively applied the laws of electrodynamics in that system, what would the prediction be? No magnetic force, because the loop is at rest. But as the magnet flies by, the magnetic field in the freight car will change, and a changing magnetic field induces an electric field, by Faraday’s law. The resulting electric force would generate an emf in the loop given by Eq. 7.14: dt Because Faraday’s law and the flux rule predict exactly the same emf, people on the train will get the right answer, even though their physical interpretation of the process is completely wrong. Or is it? Einstein could not believe this was a mere coincidence; he took it, rather, as a clue that electromagnetic phenomena, like mechanical ones, obey the principle of relativity. In his view the analysis by the observer on the train is just as valid as that of the observer on the ground. If their interpretations differ (one calling the process electric, the other magnetic), so be it; their actual predictions are in agreement. Here’s what he wrote on the first page of his 1905 paper introducing the special theory of relativity: 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 479 It is known that Maxwell’s electrodynamics—as usually understood at the present time—when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the re¬ ciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor. The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either one or the other of these bodies is in motion. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises in the neighborhood of the magnet an electric field ... producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is stationary and the conduc¬ tor in motion, no electric field arises in the neighborhood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we find an electromotive force ... which gives rise— assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed—to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case. Examples of this sort, together with unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relative to the “light medium,” suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest.2 But I’m getting ahead of the story. To Einstein’s predecessors the equality of the two emf’s was just a lucky accident; they had no doubt that one observer was right and the other was wrong. They thought of electric and magnetic fields as strains in an invisible jellylike medium called ether, which permeated all of space. The speed of the charge was to be measured with respect to the ether—only then would the laws of electrodynamics be valid. The train observer is wrong, because that frame is moving relative to the ether. But wait a minute! How do we know the ground observer isn’t moving relative to the ether, too? After all, the earth rotates on its axis once a day and revolves around the sun once a year; the solar system circulates around the galaxy, and for all I know the galaxy itself may be moving at a high speed through the cosmos. All told, we should be traveling at well over 50 km/s with respect to the ether. Like a motorcycle rider on the open road, we face an “ether wind” of high velocity—unless by some miraculous coincidence we just happen to find ourselves in a tailwind of precisely the right strength, or the earth has some sort of “windshield” and drags its local supply of ether along with it. Suddenly it becomes a matter of crucial importance to find the ether frame, experimentally, or else all our calculations will be invalid. The problem, then, is to determine our motion through the ether—to measure the speed and direction of the “ether wind.” How shall we do it? At first glance you might suppose that practically any electromagnetic experiment would suffice: If Maxwell’s equations are valid only with respect to the ether frame, any discrepancy between the experimental result and the theoretical prediction would be ascribable to the ether wind. Unfortunately, as nineteenth century physicists soon realized, the anticipated error in a typical experiment is 2 A translation of Einstein's first relativity paper, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” is reprinted in The Principle of Relativity, by H. A. Lorentz et al. (New York: Dover, 1923). 480 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY extremely small; as in the example above, “coincidences” always seem to conspire to hide the fact that we are using the “wrong” reference frame. So it takes an uncommonly delicate experiment to do the job. Now, among the results of classical electrodynamics is the prediction that electromag¬ netic waves travel through the vacuum at a speed 1 s - - = 3.00 X 108m/s, VeoMo relative (presumably) to the ether. In principle, then, one should be able to detect the ether wind by simply measuring the speed of light in various directions. Like a motorboat on a river, the net speed “downstream” should be a maximum, for here the light is swept along by the ether; in the opposite direction, where it is bucking the current, the speed should be a minimum (Fig. 12.2). While the idea of this experiment could not be simpler, its execution is another matter, because light travels so inconveniently fast. If it weren’t for that “technical detail” you could do it all with a flashlight and a stopwatch. As it happened, an elaborate and lovely experiment was devised by Michelson and Morley, using an optical interferometer of fantastic precision. I shall not go into the details here, because I do not want to distract your attention from the two essential points: (1) all Michelson and Morley were trying to do was compare the speed of light in different directions, and (2) what they in fact discovered was that this speed is exactly the same in all directions. Nowadays, when students are taught in high school to snicker at the nai vete of the ether model, it takes some imagination to comprehend how utterly perplexing this result must have been at the time. All other waves (water waves, sound waves, waves on a string) travel at a prescribed speed relative to the propagating medium (the stuff that does the waving), and if this medium is in motion with respect to the observer, the net speed is always greater “downstream” than “upstream.” Over the next 20 years a series of improbable schemes were concocted in an effort to explain why this does not occur with light. Michelson and Morley themselves interpreted their experiment as confirmation of the “ether drag” hypoth¬ esis, which held that the earth somehow pulls the ether along with it. But this was found to be inconsistent with other observations, notably the aberration of starlight.3 Various so- 3 A discussion of the Michelson-Morley experiment and related matters is to be found in R. Resnick’s Introduction to Special Relativity, Chap. 1 (New York: John Wiley, 1968). 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 481 called “emission” theories were proposed, according to which the speed of electromagnetic waves is governed by the motion of the source—as it would be in a corpuscular theory (conceiving of light as a stream of particles). Such theories called for implausible modifi¬ cations in Maxwell’s equations, but in any event they were discredited by experiments using extraterrestrial light sources. Meanwhile, Fitzgerald and Lorentz suggested that the ether wind physically compresses all matter (including the Michelson-Morley apparatus itself) in just the right way to compensate for, and thereby conceal, the variation in speed with direction. As it turns out, there is a grain of truth in this, although their idea of the reason for the contraction was quite wrong. At any rate, it was not until Einstein that anyone took the Michelson-Morley result at face value and suggested that the speed of light is a universal constant, the same in all directions, regardless of the motion of the observer or the source. There is no ether wind because there is no ether. Any inertial system is a suitable reference frame for the application of Maxwell’s equations, and the velocity of a charge is to be measured not with respect to a (nonexistent) absolute rest frame, nor with respect to a (nonexistent) ether, but simply with respect to the particular reference system you happen to have chosen. Inspired, then, both by internal theoretical hints (the fact that the laws of electrodynamics are such as to give the right answer even when applied in the “wrong” system) and by external empirical evidence (the Michelson-Morley experiment4), Einstein proposed his two famous postulates: 1. The principle of relativity. The laws of physics apply in all inertial reference systems. 2. The universal speed of light. The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the source. The special theory of relativity derives from these two postulates. The first elevates Galileo’s observation about classical mechanics to the status of a general law, applying to all of physics. It states that there is no absolute rest system. The second might be considered Einstein’s response to the Michelson-Morley experiment. It means that there is no ether. (Some authors consider Einstein’s second postulate redundant—no more than a special case of the first. They maintain that the very existence of ether would violate the principle of relativity, in the sense that it would define a unique stationary reference frame. I think this is nonsense. The existence of air as a medium for sound does not invalidate the theory of relativity. Ether is no more an absolute rest system than the water in a goldfish bowl—which is a special system, if you happen to be the goldfish, but scarcely “absolute.”)5 Unlike the principle of relativity, which had roots going back several centuries, the universal speed of light was radically new—and, on the face of it, preposterous. For if I walk 5 mi/h down the corridor of a train going 60 mi/h, my net speed relative to the ground 4 Actually, Einstein appears to have been only dimly aware of the Michelson-Morley experiment at the time. For him, the theoretical argument alone was decisive. 5I put it this way in an effort to dispel some misunderstanding as to what constitutes an absolute rest frame. In 1977, it became possible to measure the speed of the earth through the 3 K background radiation left over from the “big bang.” Does this mean we have found an absolute rest system, and relativity is out the window? Of course not. 482 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY is “obviously” 65 mi/h—the speed of A (me) with respect to C (ground) is equal to the speed of A relative to B (train) plus the speed of B relative to C: VAC = VAB + VBC• (12.1) And yet, if A is a light signal (whether is comes from a flashlight on the train or a lamp on the ground or a star in the sky) Einstein would have us believe that its speed is c relative to the train and c relative to the ground: vac = vab (12.2) Evidently, Eq. 12.1, which we now call Galileo’s velocity addition rule (no one before Einstein would have bothered to give it a name at all) is incompatible with the second postulate. In special relativity, as we shall see, it is replaced by Einstein’s velocity addition rule: VAC vab + vbc 1 + (vabvbc/c 2)' (12.3) For ordinary ’ speeds (vab « c, vbc « c), the denominator is so close to 1 that the discrepancy between Galileo’s formula and Einstein’s formula is negligible. On the other hand, Einstein’s formula has the desired property that if vAb = c, then automatically vac = c: vac c + VBC 1 +( CVbc/c2) But how can Galileo s rule, which seems to rely on nothing but common sense, possibly be wrong? And if it is wrong, what does this do to all of classical physics? The answer is that special relativity compels us to alter our notions of space and time themselves, and therefore also of such derived quantities as velocity, momentum, and energy. Although it developed historically out of Einstein’s contemplation of electrodynamics, the special theory is not limited to any particular class of phenomena—rather, it is a description of the space-time “arena” in which all physical phenomena take place. And in spite of the reference to the speed of light in the second postulate, relativity has nothing to do with light: c is evidently a fundamental velocity, and it happens that light travels at that speed, but it is perfectly possible to conceive of a universe in which there are no electric charges, and hence no electromagnetic fields or waves, and yet relativity would still prevail. Because relativity defines the structure of space and time, it claims authority not merely over all presently known phenomena, but over those not yet discovered. It is, as Kant would say, a “prolegomenon to any future physics.” Problem 12.1 Use Galileo s velocity addition rule. Let S be an inertial reference system. (a) Suppose that S moves with constant velocity relative to S. Show that S is also an inertial reference system. [Hint: use the definition in footnote 1.] (b) Conversely, show that if S is an inertial system, then it moves with respect to S at constant velocity. 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 483 Problem 12.2 As an illustration of the principle of relativity in classical mechanics, consider the following generic collision: In inertial frame S, particle A (mass velocity u^) hits particle B (mass mg, velocity ug). In the course of the collision some mass rubs off A and onto B, and we are left with particles C (mass velocity u^) and D (mass mp, velocity u/)). Assume that momentum (p = mu) is conserved in S. (a) Prove that momentum is also conserved in inertial frame 5, which moves with velocity v relative to S. [Use Galileo’s velocity addition rule—this is an entirely classical calculation. What must you assume about mass?] (b) Suppose the collision is elastic in 5; show that it is also elastic in S. Problem 12.3 (a) What’s the percent error introduced when you use Galileo’s rule, instead of Einstein’s, with vab = 5 mi/h and vgc =60 mi/h? (b) Suppose you could run at half the speed of light down the corridor of a train going three- quarters the speed of light. What would your speed be relative to the ground? (c) Prove, using Eq. 12.3, that if vab < c and vgc < c then vac < c- Interpret this result.

The muzzle velocity of the bullet (relative to the gun) is |c. Does the bullet reach its target (a) according to Galileo, (b) according to Einstein? 12.1.2 The Geometry of Relativity In this section I present a series of gedanken (thought) experiments that serve to introduce the three most striking geometrical consequences of Einstein’s postulates: time dilation, Lorentz contraction, and the relativity of simultaneity. In Sect. 12.1.3 the same results will be derived more systematically, using Lorentz transformations. (i) The relativity of simultaneity. Imagine a freight car, traveling at constant speed along a smooth, straight track (Fig. 12.4). In the very center of the car there hangs a light bulb. When someone switches it on, the light spreads out in all directions at speed c. Because the lamp is equidistant from the two ends, an observer on the train will find that the light reaches the front end at the same instant as it reaches the back end: The two events in question—(a) light reaches the front end and (b) light reaches the back end— occur simultaneously. However, to an observer on the ground these same two events are not 484 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Figure 12.4 Figure 12.5 simultaneous. For as the light travels out from the bulb, the train itself moves forward, so the beam going to the back end has a shorter distance to travel than the one going forward (Fig. 12.5). According to this observer, therefore, event (b) happens before event (a). An observer passing by on an express train, meanwhile, would report that (a) preceded (b). Conclusion: Two events that are simultaneous in one inertial system are not, in general, simultaneous in another. Naturally, the train has to be going awfully fast before the discrepancy becomes detectable— that’s why you don’t notice it all the time. Of course, it is always possible for a naive witness to be mistaken about simultaneity: you hear the thunder after you see the lightning, and a child might infer that the source of the light was not simultaneous with the source of the sound. But this is a trivial error, having nothing to do with moving observers or relativity— obviously, you must correct for the time the signal (sound, light, carrier pigeon, or whatever) takes to reach you. When I speak of an observer, I mean someone having the sense to make this correction, and an observation is what an observer records after doing so. What you see, therefore, is not the same as what you observe. An observation cannot be made with a camera—it is an artificial reconstruction after the fact, when all the data are in. In fact, a wise observer will avoid the whole problem, by stationing assistants at strategic locations, each equipped with a watch synchronized to a master clock, so that time measurements can be made right at the scene. I belabor this point in order to emphasize that the relativity of simultaneity is a genuine discrepancy between measurements made by competent observers in relative motion, not a simple mistake arising from a failure to account for the travel time of light signals. Problem 12.5 Synchronized clocks are stationed at regular intervals, a million km apart, along a straight line. When the clock next to you reads 12 noon: (a) What time do you see on the 90th clock down the line? (b) What time do you observe on that clock? Problem 12.6 Every 2 years, more or less. The New York Times publishes an article in which some astronomer claims to have found an object traveling faster than the speed of light. Many of these reports result from a failure to distinguish what is seen from what is observed—that is, from a failure to account for light travel time. Here’s an example: A star is traveling with speed v at an angle 6 to the line of sight (Fig. 12.6). What is its apparent speed across the sky ? 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 485 To earth Figure 12.6 (Suppose the light signal from b reaches the earth at a time At after the signal from a, and the star has meanwhile advanced a distance As across the celestial sphere; by “apparent speed” I mean As/At.) What angle 6 gives the maximum apparent speed? Show that the apparent speed can be much greater than c, even if v itself is less than c. (ii) Time dilation. Now let’s consider a light ray that leaves the bulb and strikes the floor of the car directly below. Question: How long does it take the light to make this trip? From the point of view of an observer on the train, the answer is easy: If the height of the car is h, the time is h At — (12.4) c (I’ll use an overbar to denote measurements made on the train.) On the other hand, as observed from the ground this same ray must travel farther, because the train itself is moving. From Fig. 12.7 I see that this distance is -//z2 + (vAt)2, so Figure 12.7 486 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Solving for At, we have h At = - c 1 v/l — v2/c 2 and therefore At = yj 1 — v2/ c2 At. (12.5) Evidently the time elapsed between the same two events—(a) light leaves bulb, and (b) light strikes center of floor—is different for the two observers. In fact, the interval recorded on the train clock, At, is shorter by the factor 1 sj 1 — v2 jc1 (12 .6) Conclusion: Moving clocks run slow. This is called time dilation. It doesn’t have anything to do with the mechanics of clocks; it’s a statement about the nature of time, which applies to all properly functioning timepieces. Of all Einstein’s predictions, none has received more spectacular and persuasive confir¬ mation than time dilation. Most elementary particles are unstable: they disintegrate after a characteristic lifetime6 that varies from one species to the next. The lifetime of a neutron is 15 min, of a muon, 2 x 10 6 s, of a neutral pion, 9 x 10“17 s. But these are lifetimes of particles at rest. When particles are moving at speeds close to c they last much longer, for their internal clocks (whatever it is that tells them when their time is up) are running slow, in accordance with Einstein’s time dilation formula. Example 12.1 A muon is traveling through the laboratory at three-fifths the speed of light. How long does it last? Solution: In this case, - 1 _ 5 Y ~ v7! - (3/5)2 ~ 4' so it lives longer (than at rest) by a factor of |: ^ x (2 x 10-6 ) s = 2.5 x 10“6s . 6 Actually, an individual particle may last longer or shorter than this. Particle disintegration is a random process, and I should really speak of the average lifetime for the species. But to avoid irrelevant complication I shall pretend that every particle disintegrates after precisely the average lifetime. 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 487 It may strike you that time dilation is inconsistent with the principle of relativity. For if the ground observer says the train clock runs slow, the train observer can with equal justice claim that the ground clock runs slow—after all, from the train’s point of view it is the ground that is in motion. Who’s right? Answer: They’re both right! On closer inspection the “contradiction,” which seems so stark, evaporates. Let me explain: In order to check the rate of the train clock, the ground observer uses two of his own clocks (Fig. 12.8): one to compare times at the beginning of the interval, when the train clock passes point A, the other to compare times at the end of the interval, when the train clock passes point B. Of course, he must be careful to synchronize his clocks before the experiment. What he finds is that while the train clock ticked off, say, 3 minutes, the interval between his own two clock readings was 5 minutes. He concludes that the train clock runs slow. Train clock Ground clock A Ground clock B Train clock B Train clock A Figure 12.8 Figure 12.9 Meanwhile, the observer on the train is checking the rate of the ground clock by the same procedure: She uses two carefully synchronized train clocks, and compares times with a single ground clock as it passes by each of them in turn (Fig. 12.9). She finds that while the ground clock ticks off 3 minutes, the interval between her train clocks is 5 min¬ utes, and concludes that the ground clock runs slow. Is there a contradiction? No, for the two observers have measured different things. The ground observer compared one train clock with two ground clocks; the train observer compared one ground clock with two train clocks. Each followed a sensible and correct procedure, comparing a single moving clock with two stationary ones. “So what,” you say, “the stationary clocks were synchronized in each instance, so it cannot matter that they used two different ones.” But there’s the rub: Clocks that are properly synchronized in one system will not be synchronized when observed from another system. They can’t be, for to say that two clocks are synchronized is to say that they read 12 noon simultaneously, and we have already learned that what’s simultaneous to one observer is not simultaneous to another. So whereas each observer conducted a perfectly sound measurement, from his/her own point of view, the other ob¬ server, watching the process, considers that she/he made the most elementary blunder, by using two unsynchronized clocks. That’s how, in spite of the fact that his clocks “actually” run slow, he manages to conclude that hers are running slow (and vice versa). 488 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Because moving clocks are not synchronized, it is essential when checking time dilation to focus attention on a single moving clock. All moving clocks run slow by the same factor, but you can’t start timing on one clock and then switch to another because they weren’t in step to begin with. But you can use as many stationary clocks (stationary with respect to you, the observer) as you please, for they are properly synchronized (moving observers would dispute this, but that’s their problem). Example 12.2 The twin paradox. On her 21st birthday, an astronaut takes off in a rocket ship at a speed of jjC. After 5 years have elapsed on her watch, she turns around and heads back at the same speed to rejoin her twin brother, who stayed at home. Question: How old is each twin at their reunion? Solution: The traveling twin has aged 10 years (5 years out, 5 years back); she arrives at home just in time to celebrate her 31st birthday. However, as viewed from earth, the moving clock has been running slow by a factor _ 1_13 sj\\ - (12/13)2 5 ' The time elapsed on earthbound clocks is ^ x 10 = 26, and her brother will be therefore celebrating his 47th birthday—he is now 16 years older than his twin sister! But don’t be deceived: This is no fountain of youth for the traveling twin, for though she may die later than her brother, she will not have lived any more—she’s just done it slower. During the flight, all her biological processes—metabolism, pulse, thought, and speech—are subject to the same time dilation that affects her watch. The so-called twin paradox arises when you try to tell this story from the point of view of the traveling twin. She sees the earth fly off at j|c, turn around after 5 years, and return. From her point of view, it would seem, she’s at rest, whereas her brother is in motion, and hence it is he who should be younger at the reunion. An enormous amount has been written about the twin paradox, but the truth is there’s really no paradox here at all: this second analysis is simply wrong. The two twins are not equivalent. The traveling twin experiences acceleration when she turns around to head home, but her brother does not. To put it in fancier language, the traveling twin is not in an inertial system—more precisely, she’s in one inertial system on the way out and a completely different one on the way back. You’ll see in Prob. 12.16 how to analyze this problem correctly from her point of view, but as far as the resolution of the “paradox” is concerned, it is enough to note that the traveling twin cannot claim to be a stationary observer because you can’t undergo acceleration and remain stationary. Problem 12.7 In a laboratory experiment a muon is observed to travel 800 m before disinte¬ grating. A graduate student looks up the lifetime of a muon (2 x 10-6 s) and concludes that its speed was 800 m = 4 x 108 2 x 10—6 s Faster than light! Identify the student’s error, and find the m/s. actual speed of this muon. 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 489 Problem 12.8 A rocket ship leaves earth at a speed of |c. When a clock on the rocket says 1 hour has elapsed, the rocket ship sends a light signal back to earth. (a) According to earth clocks, when was the signal sent? (b) According to earth clocks, how long after the rocket left did the signal arrive back on earth? (c) According to the rocket observer, how long after the rocket left did the signal arrive back on earth? (iii) Lorentz contraction. For the third gedanken experiment you must imagine that we have set up a lamp at one end of a boxcar and a mirror at the other, so that a light signal can be sent down and back (Fig. 12.10). Question: How long does the signal take to complete the round trip? To an observer on the train, the answer is At — 2-, (12.7) c where Ax is the length of the car (the overbar, as before, denotes measurements made on the train). To an observer on the ground the process is more complicated because of the motion of the train. If Afj is the time for the light signal to reach the front end, and At 2 is the return time, then (see Fig. 12.11): Ax + vAt] Ati =- c or, solving for Afi and AA: . Ax — i> At? A t2 = -- c So the round-trip time is At] Ax c — v ’ A?2 = Ax c + v At = Ati + At2 = Ax 1 2- . c (1 — v2/c 2) (12.8) Meanwhile, these same intervals are related by the time dilation formula, Eq. 12.5: At = Jl — v2/c 2 At. Figure 12.10 Figure 12.11 490 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Applying this to Eqs. 12.7 and 12.8,1 conclude that 1 Ax = . = Ax. y/1 — V2 jc 1 (12.9) The length of the boxcar is not the same when measured by an observer on the ground, as it is when measured by an observer on the train—from the ground point of view it is somewhat shorter. Conclusion: Moving objects are shortened. We call this Lorentz contraction. Notice that the same factor, 1 y/l ~ U2/C 2 appears in both the time dilation formula and the Lorentz contraction formula. This makes it all very easy to remember: Moving clocks run slow, moving sticks are shortened, and the factor is always y. Of course, the observer on the train doesn’t think her car is shortened—her meter sticks are contracted by that same factor, so all her measurements come out the same as when the train was standing in the station. In fact, from her point of view it is objects on the ground that are shortened. This raises again a paradoxical problem: If A says B’s sticks are short, and B says A’s sticks are short, who is right? Answer: They both are! But to reconcile the rival claims we must study carefully the actual process by which length is measured. Suppose you want to find the length of a board. If it’s at rest (with respect to you) you simply lay your ruler down next to the board, record the readings at each end, and subtract them to get the length of the board (Fig. 12.12). (If you’re really clever, you’ll line up the left end of the ruler against the left end of the board—then you only have to read one number.) But what if the board is movingl Same story, only this time, of course, you must be careful to read the two ends at the same instant of time. If you don’t, the board will move in the course of measurement, and obviously you’ll get the wrong answer. But therein lies the problem: Because of the relativity of simultaneity the two observers disagree on what constitutes “the same instant of time.” When the person on the ground measures the length of the boxcar, he reads the position of the two ends at the same instant in his system. But Board 11 1 111 1 111 1 11 1 II | II 1 | 1 II | 1 II | 1 II | 1 II | 1 II | ! II | II 1 | Ruler Figure 12.12 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 491 the person on the train, watching him do it, complains that he read the front end first, then waited a moment before reading the back end. Naturally, he came out short, in spite of the fact that (to her) he was using an undersized meter stick, which would otherwise have yielded a number too large. Both observers measure lengths correctly (from the point of view of their respective inertial frames) and each finds the other’s sticks to be shortened. Yet there is no inconsistency, for they are measuring different things, and each considers the other’s method improper. Example 12.3 The barn and ladder paradox. Unlike time dilation, there is no direct experimental confir¬ mation of Lorentz contraction, simply because it's too difficult to get an object of measurable size going anywhere near the speed of light. The following parable illustrates how bizarre the world would be if the speed of light were more accessible. There once was a farmer who had a ladder too long to store in his barn (Fig. 12.13a). He chanced one day to read some relativity, and a solution to his problem suggested itself. He instructed his daughter to run with the ladder as fast as she could—the moving ladder having Lorentz-contracted to a size the bam could easily accommodate, she was to rush through the door, whereupon the fanner would slam it behind her, capturing the ladder inside (Fig. 12.13b). The daughter, however, has read somewhat farther in the relativity book; she points out that in her reference frame the barn, not the ladder, will contract, and the fit will be even worse than it was with the two at rest (Fig. 12.13c). Question: Who’s right? Will the ladder fit inside the bam, or won’t it? (a) (b) N (c) Figure 12.13 492 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Solution: They’re both right! When you say “the ladder is in the bam,” you mean that all parts of it are inside at one instant of time, but in view of the relativity of simultaneity, that’s a condition that depends on the observer. There are really two relevant events here: a. Back end of ladder makes it in the door. b. Front end of ladder hits far wall of bam. The farmer says a occurs before b, so there is a time when the ladder is entirely within the bam; his daughter says b precedes a, so there is not. Contradiction? Nope—just a difference in perspective. “But come now,” I hear you protest, “when it’s all over and the dust clears, either the ladder is inside the bam, or it isn’t. There can be no dispute about that?' Quite so, but now you’re introducing a new element into the story: What happens as the ladder is brought to a stop? Suppose the farmer grabs the last rung of the ladder firmly with one hand, while he slams the door with the other. Assuming it remains intact, the ladder must now stretch out to its rest length. Evidently, the front end keeps going, even after the rear end has been stopped! Expanding like an accordian, the front end of the ladder smashes into the far side of the bam. In truth, the whole notion of a “rigid” object loses its meaning in relativity, for when it changes its speed, different parts do not in general accelerate simultaneously—in this way the material stretches or shrinks to reach the length appropriate to its new velocity. But to return to the question at hand: When the ladder finally comes to a stop, is it inside the bam or not? The answer is indeterminate. When the front end of the ladder hits the far side of the bam, something has to give, and the farmer is left either with a broken ladder inside the bam or with the ladder intact poking through a hole in the wall. In any event, he is unlikely to be pleased with the outcome. One final comment on Lorentz contraction. A moving object is shortened only along the direction of its motion: Dimensions perpendicular to the velocity are not contracted. Indeed, in deriving the time dilation formula I took it for granted that the height of the train is the same for both observers. I’ll now justify this, using a lovely gedanken experiment suggested by Taylor and Wheeler.7 Imagine that we build a wall beside the railroad tracks, and 1 m above the rails, as measured on the ground, we paint a horizontal blue line. When the train goes by, a passenger leans out the window holding a wet paintbrush 1 m above the rails, as measured on the train, leaving a horizontal red line on the wall. Question: Does the passenger’s red line lie above or below our blue one? If the rule were that perpendicular directions contract, then the person on the ground would predict that the red line is lower, while the person on the train would say it’s the blue one (to the latter, of course, the ground is moving). The principle of relativity says that both observers are equally justified, but they cannot both be right. No subtleties of simultaneity or synchronization can rationalize this contradiction; either the blue line is higher or the red one is— unless they exactly coincide, 7E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, Spacetime Physics (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1966). A somewhat different version of the same argument is given in J. H. Smith, Introduction to Special Relativity (Champaign, IL: Stipes, 1965). 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 493 which is the inescapable conclusion. There cannot be a law of contraction (or expansion) of perpendicular dimensions, for it would lead to irreconcilably inconsistent predictions. Problem 12.9 A Lincoln Continental is twice as long as a VW Beetle, when they are at rest. As the Continental overtakes the VW, going through a speed trap, a (stationary) policeman observes that they both have the same length. The VW is going at half the speed of light. How fast is the Lincoln going? (Leave your answer as a multiple of c.) Problem 12.10 A sailboat is manufactured so that the mast leans at an angle § with respect to the deck. An observer standing on a dock sees the boat go by at speed v (Fig. 12.14). What angle does this observer say the mast makes? Figure 12.14 Figure 12.15 Problem 12.11 A record turntable of radius R rotates at angular velocity o> (Fig. 12.15). The circumference is presumably Lorentz-contracted, but the radius (being perpendicular to the velocity) is not. What’s the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, in terms of co and R! According to the rules of ordinary geometry, that has to be n. What’s going on here? [This is known as Ehrenfest’s paradox; for discussion and references see H. Arzelies, Relativistic Kinematics, Chap. IX (Elmsford, NY: Pergamon Press, 1966) and T. A. Weber, Am. J. Phys. 65, 486(1997).] 12.1.3 The Lorentz Transformations Any physical process consists of one or more events. An “event” is something that takes place at a specific location (x, y, z), at a precise time (t). The explosion of a firecracker, for example, is an event; a tour of Europe is not. Suppose that we know the coordinates (x, y, z) of a particular event E in one inertial system S, and we would like to calculate the coordinates (i, y. z, t) of that same event in some other inertial system S. What we need is a “dictionary” for translating from the language of S to the language of S. 494 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY y y V O t E x * X Figure 12.16 We may as well orient our axes as shown in Fig. 12.16, so that S slides along the x axis at speed v. If we “start the clock” (t — 0) at the moment the origins (O and O) coincide, then at time t, O will be a distance vt from O, and hence x = d + vt, (12.10) where d is the distance from O to A at time t (A is the point on the x axis which is even with E when the event occurs). Before Einstein, anyone would have said immediately that d = x, (12.11) and thus constructed the “dictionary” (i) x = x — vt (ii) y = y, (hi) z = z, (12 .12 ) (iv) t = t. J These are now called the Galilean transformations, though they scarcely deserve so fine a title—the last one, in particular, went without saying, since everyone assumed the flow of time was the same for all observers. In the context of special relativity, however, we must expect (iv) to be replaced by a rule that incorporates time dilation, the relativity of simultaneity, and the nonsynchronization of moving clocks. Likewise, there will be a modification in (i) to account for Lorentz contraction. As for (ii) and (iii), they, at least, remain unchanged, for we have already seen that there can be no modification of lengths perpendicular to the motion. But where does the classical derivation of (i) break down? Answer: In Eq. 12.11. For d is the distance from O to A as measured in S, whereas jc is the distance from O to A as 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEOR Y OF RELATIVITY 495 measured in S. Because O and A contracted to S: are at rest in S, x is the “moving stick,” which appears (12.13) When this is inserted in Eq. 12.10 we obtain the relativistic version of (i): x = y (x — vt). (12.14) Of course, we could have run the same argument from the point of view of S. The diagram (Fig. 12.17) looks similar, but in this case it depicts the scene at time t, whereas Fig. 12.16 showed the scene at time t. (Note that t and t represent the same physical instant at E, but not elsewhere, because of the relativity of simultaneity.) If we assume that S also starts the clock when the origins coincide, then at time t, O will be a distance vt from O, and therefore x=d-vt, (12.15) where d is the distance from O to ,4 at time t, and A is that point on the x axis which is even with E when the event occurs. The classical physicist would have said that x = d, and, using (iv), recovered (i). But, as before, relativity demands that we observe a subtle distinction: x is the distance from O to A in S, whereas d is the distance from O to A in S. Because O and A are at rest in S , x is the “moving stick,” and d = 1 —x. y (12.16) It follows that x = y(x + vt). (12.17) This last equation comes as no surprise, for the symmetry of the situation dictates that the formula for x, in terms of x and t. should be identical to the formula for x in terms of x and t (Eq. 12.14), except for a switch in the sign of v. (If S is going to the right at speed >'t J V O z z d Figure 12.17 496 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY v, with respect to S, then S is going to the left at speed v, with respect to S.) Nevertheless, this is a useful result, for if we substitute x from Eq. 12.14, and solve for t, we complete the relativistic “dictionary”: (i) x = y(x — vt), (ii) y = y, (iii) z = z, (iv) t = y(t- ^x) . (12.18) These are the famous Lorentz transformations, with which Einstein replaced the Galilean ones. They contain all the geometrical information in the special theory, as the following examples illustrate. The reverse dictionary, which carries you from <S back to S, can be obtained algebraically by solving (i) and (iv) for x and t, or, more simply, by switching the sign of v: (i') x - y(x + vt), ) (ii') y = y, (iii') z = z, (iv') t = y(t + ^x) . (12.19) Example 12.4 Simultaneity, synchronization, and time dilation. Suppose event A occurs at = 0. i a = 0, and event B occurs at xg = b,tg = 0. The two events are simultaneous in S (they both take place at t = 0). But they are not simultaneous in 5, for the Lorentz transformations give xa = 0, Lt = 0 and xg = yb, tg = —y(v/c2)b. According to the S clocks, then, B occurred before A. This is nothing new, of course—just the relativity of simultaneity. But I wanted you to see how it follows from the Lorentz transformations. Now suppose that at time t = 0 observer S decides to examine all the clocks in S. He finds that they read different times, depending on their location; from (iv): v t = -y-jx. cA Those to the left of the origin (negative x) are ahead, and those to the right are behind, by an amount that increases in proportion to their distance (Fig. 12.18). Only the master clock at the origin reads t = 0. Thus, the nonsynchronization of moving clocks, too, follows directly from the Lorentz transformations. Of course, from the S viewpoint it is the S clocks that are out of synchronization, as you can check by putting t = 0 into equation (iv'). 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 497 S clocks x = 0 V x = 0 rTYTYTYtYTYTYT) Sc locks Figure 12.18 Finally, suppose S focuses his attention on a single clock in the S frame (say, the one at x = a), and watches it over some interval At. How much time elapses on the moving clock? Because x is fixed, (iv/) gives At = yAt, or . 1 At = —At. Y That’s the old time dilation formula, derived now from the Lorentz transformations. Please note that it’s x we hold fixed, here, because we’re watching one moving clock. If you hold x fixed, then you’re watching a whole series of different S clocks as they pass by, and that won’t tell you whether any one of them is running slow. Example 12.5 Lorentz contraction. Imagine a stick moving to the right at speed v. Its rest length (that is, its length as measured in S) is Ax = xr — xi, where the subscripts denote the right and left ends of the stick. If an observer in S were to measure the stick, he would subtract the positions of the two ends at one instant of his time t: Ax = xr — X[. According to (i), then, Ax = — Ax. Y This is the old Lorentz contraction formula. Note that it’s t we hold fixed, here, because we’re talking about a measurement made by S, and he marks off the two ends at the same instant of his time. (S doesn’t have to be so fussy, since the stick is at rest in her frame.) Example 12.6 Einstein’s velocity addition rule. Suppose a particle moves a distance dx (in S ) in a time dt. Its velocity u is then dx 498 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY In S, meanwhile, it has moved a distance dx = y(dx — vdt), as we see from (i), in a time given by (iv): The velocity in S is therefore _ _ dx _ y(dx — vdt) (dx/dt — v) u — v dt y (dt - v/c 2dx) 1 — v/c 2dx/dt 1 — uv/c 2 (12 .20) This is Einstein’s velocity addition rule. To recover the more transparent notation of Eq. 12.3, let A be the particle, B be S, and C be <S; then u = v^b- « = and v = vcb = ~vbc> so Eq. 12.20 becomes VAB + vbc vac =- y~> 1 + (vabVbc/c 2) as before. Problem 12.12 Solve Eqs. 12.18 for x, y, z, t in terms of a , y. z, t, and check that you recover Eqs. 12.19. Problem 12.13 Sophie Zabar, clairvoyante, cried out in pain at precisely the instant her twin brother, 500 km away, hit his thumb with a hammer. A skeptical scientist observed both events (brother’s accident, Sophie’s cry) from an airplane traveling at c to the right (see Fig. 12.19). Which event occurred first, according to the scientist? How much earlier was it, in seconds? Problem 12.14 (a) In Ex. 12.6 we found how velocities in the a direction transform when you go from S to S. Derive the analogous formulas for velocities in the y and z directions. (b) A spotlight is mounted on a boat so that its beam makes an angle 9 with the deck (Fig. 12.20). If this boat is then set in motion at speed v, what angle 9 does an observer on the dock say the beam makes with the deck? Compare Prob. 12.10, and explain the difference. Problem 12.15 You probably did Prob. 12.4 from the point of view of an observer on the ground. Now do it from the point of view of the police car, tjie outlaws, and the bullet.

On their 21 st birthday, one twin gets on a moving sidewalk, which carries her out to star X at speed |c; her twin brother stays home. When the traveling twin gets to star X, she immediately jumps onto the returning moving sidewalk and comes back to earth, again at speed |c. She arrives on her 39th birthday (as determined by her watch). (a) How old is her twin brother (who stayed at home)? (b) How far away is star X? (Give your answer in light years.)

(g) If the traveling twin is asked the question, “How old is your brother right nowT, what is the correct reply (i) just before she makes the jump, (ii) just after she makes the jump?

ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY 12.1.4 The Structure of Spacetime (i) Four-vectors. The Lorentz transformations take on a simpler appearance when expressed in terms of the quantities x° = ct, /? = -. (12.21) c Using x° (instead of t) and P (instead of v) amounts to changing the unit of time from the second to the meter—1 meter of x° corresponds to the time it takes light to travel 1 meter (in vacuum). If, at the same time, we number the x, y, z coordinates, so that 1 2 3 x —x, x = y, x = z, then the Lorentz transformations read X° = y(x° — fix1), X1 = y(x‘ - fix0), (12 .22) (12.23) Or, in matrix form: / \\ ( y -yP o 0 \\ -yP y 0 0 0 0 10 V X6 ) \\ 0 0 01/ X2 / x° \\ x1 x2 \\x 3/ (12.24) Letting Greek indices run from 0 to 3, this can be distilled into a single equation: 3 xM = ^(A(()x v, (12.25) v=0 where A is the Lorentz transformation matrix in Eq. 12.24 (the superscript n labels the row, the subscript v labels the column). One virtue of writing things in this abstract manner is that we can handle in the same format a more general transformation, in which the relative motion is not along a common x x axis; the matrix A would be more complicated, but the structure of Eq. 12.25 is unchanged. If this reminds you of the rotations we studied in Sect. 1.1.5, it’s no accident. There we were concerned with the change in components when you switch to a rotated coordinate system; here we are interested in the change of components when you go to a moving 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 501 system. In Chapter 1 we defined a (3-) vector as any set of three components that transform under rotations the same way (x,y,z) do; by extension, we now define a 4-vector as any set offour components that transform in the same manner as (jc°, x1, x2, x3) under Lorentz transformations: 3 = A(V- (12.26) v=0 For the particular case of a transformation along the x axis: a0 = y(a° — ,6a1), a1 = y (a1 — ,8a°), (12.27) There is a 4-vector analog to the dot product (A • B = AXB X + AyB y + AZB Z), but it’s not just the sum of the products of like components; rather, the zeroth components have a minus sign: —a°b° + alb l + a2b 2 + a3b 3. (12.28) This is the four-dimensional scalar product; you should check for yourself (Prob. 12.17) that it has the same value in all inertial systems: -a°b° + alb l + a2b 2 + d3b 3 = - a°b° + alb l + a2b 2 + a3b 3. (12.29) Just as the ordinary dot product is invariant (unchanged) under rotations, this combination is invariant under Lorentz transformations. To keep track of the minus sign it is convenient to introduce the covariant vector a^, which differs from the contravariant only in the sign of the zeroth component: aM = (a0, a\\, a2, aj) = (-a 0, a1, a2, a3). (12.30) You must be scrupulously careful about the placement of indices in this business: upper indices designate contravariant vectors; lower indices are for covariant vectors. Raising or lowering the temporal index costs a minus sign (a0 = -a 0); raising or lowering a spatial index changes nothing (ai = a1, «2 = a2, a;; = a3). The scalar product can now be written with the summation symbol, 3 fi~ o or, more compactly still, a^. (12.32) Summation is implied whenever a Greek index is repeated in a product—once as a covariant index and once as contravariant. This is called the Einstein summation convention, after 502 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY its inventor, who regarded it as one of his most important contributions. Of course, we could as well take care of the minus sign by switching to covariant b: = -a°b° + alb l + a2b 2 + a3b 3. (12.33) Problem 12.17 Check Eq. 12.29, using Eq. 12.27. [This only proves the invariance of the scalar product for transformations along the x direction. But the scalar product is also invariant under rotations, since the first term is not affected at all, and the last three constitute the three- dimensional dot product ab. By a suitable rotation, the x direction can be aimed any way you please, so the four-dimensional scalar product is actually invariant under arbitrary Lorentz transformations.] Problem 12.18 (a) Write out the matrix that describes a Galilean transformation (Eq. 12.12). (b) Write out the matrix describing a Lorentz transformation along the y axis. (c) Find the matrix describing a Lorentz transformation with velocity v along the x axis followed by a Lorentz transformation with velocity v along the y axis. Does it matter in what order the transformations are carried out? Problem 12.19 The parallel between rotations and Lorentz transformations is even more strik¬ ing if we introduce the rapidity: 9 = tanh-1 (v/c). (12.34) (a) Express the Lorentz transformation matrix A (Eq. 12.24) in terms of 9, and compare it to the rotation matrix (Eq. 1.29). In some respects rapidity is a more natural way to describe motion than velocity. [See E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, Spacetime Physics (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1966).] For one thing, it ranges from —oo to +oo, instead of — c to +c. More significantly, rapidities add. whereas velocities do not. (b) Express the Einstein velocity addition law in terms of rapidity. (ii) The invariant interval. Suppose event A occurs at (x° , x\\, x2A,x \\), and event B at (Xg, Xg, Xg, Xg). The difference. Ax^=x^-xg, (12.35) is the displacement 4-vector. The scalar product of AxM with itself is a quantity of special importance; we call it the interval between two events: 1 = (Ax)M(Ax)^ = -(Ax 0)2 + (Ax1)2 + (Ax2)2 + (Ax3)2 = -c 2t2 + d 2, (12.36) where t is the time difference between the two events and d is their spatial separation. When you transform to a moving system, the time between A and B is altered (I / t), and so is the spatial separation (d ^ d), but the interval I remains the same. 12.1. THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 503 Depending on the two events in question, the interval can be positive, negative, or zero: 1. If I < 0 we call the interval timelike, for this is the sign we get when the two occur at the same place (d = 0), and are separated only temporally. 2. If I > 0 we call the interval spacelike, for this is the sign we get when the two occur at the same time (t =0), and are separated only spatially. 3. If I = 0 we call the interval lightlike, for this is the relation that holds when the two events are connected by a signal traveling at the speed of light. If the interval between the two events is timelike, there exists an inertial system (accessible by Lorentz transformation) in which they occur at the same point. For if I hop on a train going from (A) to (B) at the speed v — d/t, leaving event A when it occurs, I shall be just in time to pass B when it occurs; in the train system, A and B take place at the same point. You cannot do this for a spacelike interval, of course, because v would have to be greater than c, and no observer can exceed the speed of light (y would be imaginary and the Lorentz transformations would be nonsense). On the other hand, if the interval is spacelike, then there exists a system in which the two events occur at the same time (see Prob. 12.21). Problem 12.20 (a) Event A happens at point (xA =5 ,y A = 3, za = 0) and at time tA given by ctA = 15; event B occurs at (10, 8, 0) and ctg = 5, both in system S. (i) What is the invariant interval between A and S? (ii) Is there an inertial system in which they occur simultaneously? If so, find its velocity (magnitude and direction) relative to S. (iii) Is there an inertial system in which they occur at the same point? If so, find its velocity relative to S (b) Repeat part (a) for A = (2, 0, 0), ct = 1; and B = (5, 0, 0), ct = 3. Problem 12.21 The coordinates of event A are (xA. 0, 0). iA- and the coordinates of event B are (xg,0,0),tg. Assuming the interval between them is spacelike, find the velocity of the system in which they are simultaneous. (iii) Space-time diagrams. If you want to represent the motion of a particle graphically, the normal practice is to plot the position versus time (that is, x runs vertically and t horizontally). On such a graph, the velocity can be read off as the slope of the curve. For some reason the convention is reversed in relativity: everyone plots position horizontally and time (or, better, x° = ct) vertically. Velocity is then given by the reciprocal of the slope. A particle at rest is represented by a vertical line; a photon, traveling at the speed of light, is described by a 45° line; and a rocket going at some intermediate speed follows a line of slope c/v = 1//J (Fig. 12.21). We call such plots Minkowski diagrams. The trajectory of a particle on a Minkowski diagram is called a world line. Suppose you set out from the origin at time t = 0. Because no material object can travel faster than light, your world line can never have a slope less than 1. Accordingly, your motion is 504 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Your future at t restricted to the wedge-shaped region bounded by the two 45° lines (Fig. 12.22). We call this your “future,” in the sense that it is the locus of all points accessible to you. Of course, as time goes on, and you move along your chosen world line, your options progressively narrow: your “future” at any moment is the forward “wedge” constructed at whatever point you find yourself. Meanwhile, the backward wedge represents your “past,” in the sense that it is the locus of all points from which you might have come. As for the rest (the region outside the forward and backward wedges) this is the generalized “present.” You can’t get there, and you didn’t come from there. In fact, there’s no way can can influence any event in the present (the message would have to travel faster than light); it’s a vast expanse of spacetime that is absolutely inaccessible to you. I’ve been ignoring the y and z directions. If we include a y axis coming out of the page, the “wedges” become cones—and, with an undrawable z axis, hypercones. Because their boundaries are the trajectories of light rays, we call them the forward light cone and the backward light cone. Your future, in other words, lies within your forward light cone, your past within your backward light cone. Notice that the slope of the line connecting two events on a space-time diagram tells you at a glance whether the invariant interval between them is timelike (slope greater than 1), spacelike (slope less than 1), or lightlike (slope 1). For example, all points in the past and future are timelike with respect to your present location, whereas points in the present are spacelike, and points on the light cone are lightlike. Hermann Minkowski, who was the first to recognize the full geometrical significance of special relativity, began a classic paper with the words, “Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.” It is a lovely thought, but you must be careful THE SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 505 12.1. Figure 12.23 not to read too much into it. For it is not at all the case that time is “just another coordinate, on the same footing with x, y, and z” (except that for obscure reasons we measure it on clocks instead of rulers). No: Time is utterly different from the others, and the mark of its distinction is the minus sign in the invariant interval. That minus sign imparts to spacetime a hyperbolic geometry that is much richer than the circular geometry of 3-space. Under rotations about the z axis, a point P in the xy plane describes a circle: the locus of all points a fixed distance r = Jx 2 + y2 from the origin (Fig. 12.23). Under Lorentz transformations, however, it is the interval I = (x2- c2t 2) that is preserved, and the locus of all points with a given value of / is a hyperbola—or, if we include the y axis, a hyperboloid of revolution. When the interval is timelike, it’s a “hyperboloid of two sheets” (Fig. 12.24a); when the interval is spacelike, it’s a “hyperboloid of one sheet” (Fig. 12.24b). When you perform a Lorentz transformation (that is, when you go into a moving inertial system), the coordinates (x, t) of a given event will change to (x, t), but these new coordinates will lie on the same hyperbola as (x, t). By appropriate combinations of Lorentz transformations Figure 12.24 506 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY and rotations, a spot can be moved around at will over the surface of a given hyperboloid, but no amount of transformation will carry it, say, from the upper sheet of the timelike hyperboloid to the lower sheet, or to a spacelike hyperboloid. When we were discussing simultaneity I pointed out that the time ordering of two events can, at least in certain cases, be reversed, simply by going into a moving system. But we now see that this is not always possible: If the invariant interval between two events is timelike, their ordering is absolute; if the interval is spacelike, their ordering depends on the inertial system from which they are observed. In terms of the space-time diagram, an event on the upper sheet of a timelike hyperboloid definitely occurred after (0, 0), and one on the lower sheet certainly occurred before; but an event on a spacelike hyperboloid occurred at positive t, or negative t, depending on your reference frame. This is not an idle curiosity, for it rescues the notion of causality, on which all physics is based. If it were always possible to reverse the order of two events, then we could never say “A caused B,” since a rival observer would retort that B preceded A. This embarrassment is avoided, provided the two events are timelike-separated. And causally related events are timelike-separated—otherwise no influence could travel from one to the other. Conclusion: The invariant interval between causally related events is always timelike, and their temporal ordering is the same for all inertial observers. Problem 12.22 (a) Draw a space-time diagram representing a game of catch (or a conversation) between two people at rest, 10 ft apart. How is it possible for them to communicate, given that their separation is spacelike? (b) There’s an old limerick that mns as follows: There once was a girl named Ms. Bright, Who could travel much faster than light. She departed one day, The Einsteinian way. And returned on the previous night. What do you think? Even if she could travel faster than the speed of light, could she return before she set out? Could she arrive at some intermediate destination before she set out? Draw a space-time diagram representing this trip. Problem 12.23 Inertial system S moves in the x direction at speed |c relative to system S. (The x axis slides long the * axis, and the origins coincide at t = t = 0, as usual.) (a) On graph paper set up a Cartesian coordinate system with axes ct and x. Carefully draw in lines representing x = —3, —2, —1,0, 1,2, and 3. Also draw in the lines corresponding to ct = —3, —2, —1,0, 1,2, and 3. Label your lines clearly. (b) In S, a free particle is observed to travel from the point x = — 2 at time ct = —2 to the point x = 2 at ct = +3. Indicate this displacement on your graph. From the slope of this line, determine the particle’s speed in S. (c) Use the velocity addition mle to determine the velocity in S algebraically, and check that your answer is consistent with the graphical solution in (b). 12.2. RELATIVISTIC MECHANICS 507 12.2 Relativistic Mechanics 12.2.1 Proper Time and Proper Velocity As you progress along your world line, your watch runs slow; while the clock on the wall ticks off an interval dt, your watch only advances d r: dz — J 1 — u2/c 2 dt. (12.37) (I’ll use u for the velocity of a particular object—you, in this instance—and reserve v for the relative velocity of two inertial systems.) The time r your watch registers (or, more generally, the time associated with the moving object) is called proper time. (The word suggests a mistranslation of the French propre, meaning “own.”) In some cases r may be a more relevant or useful quantity than t. For one thing, proper time is invariant, whereas “ordinary” time depends on the particular reference frame you have in mind. Now, imagine you’re on a flight to Los Angeles, and the pilot announces that the plane’s velocity is |c, due South. What precisely does he mean by “velocity”? Well, of course, he means the displacement divided by the time: <71 u = —, dt (12.38) and, since he is presumably talking about the velocity relative to ground, both dl and dt are to be measured by the ground observer. That’s the important number to know, if you’re concerned about being on time for an appointment in Los Angeles, but if you’re wondering whether you’ll be hungry on arrival, you might be more interested in the distance covered per unit proper time: d\\ 1 = t- (12.39) d r This hybrid quantity—distance measured on the ground, over time measured in the airplane— is called proper velocity; for contrast, I’ll call u the ordinary velocity. The two are related by Eq. 12.37: 1 -y/l — U2 jC 2 (12.40) For speeds much less than c, of course, the difference between ordinary and proper velocity is negligible. From a theoretical standpoint, however, proper velocity has an enormous advantage over ordinary velocity: it transforms simply, when you go from one inertial system to another. In fact, r) is the spatial part of a 4-vector, whose zeroth component is n _ dx^ dz r] 0 dx° dt dz dz c y/1 — u2/c 2 (12.41) (12.42) 508 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY For the numerator, dx^, is a displacement 4-vector, while the denominator, dr, is invariant. Thus, for instance, when you go from system S to system S, moving at speed v along the common x x axis, if = Y{rf - fir]1), f]1 = Yin1 ~ fir]0), -2 2 t] — t] , (12.43) More generally, -3 3 t] = v . ^ = A(V; (12.44) rf' is called the proper velocity 4-vector, or simply the 4-velocity. By contrast, the transformation rule for ordinary velocities is extremely cumbersome, as we found in Ex. 12.6 and Prob. 12.14: dx ux — v x dt (l-vu x/ c2)’ dy uy y dt y( 1 — vux/ c2) ’ dz uz Z dt y( 1 — vux/ c2) (12.45) The reason for the added complexity is plain: we’re obliged to transform both the numerator dl and the denominator dt, whereas for proper velocity the denominator dr is invariant, so the ratio inherits the transformation rule of the numerator alone. Problem 12.24 (a) Equation 12.40 defines proper velocity in terms of ordinary velocity. Invert that equation to get the formula for u in terms of t). (b) What is the relation between proper velocity and rapidity (Eq. 12.34)? Assume the velocity is along the x direction, and find rj as a function of 9.

ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Relativistic momentum is the spatial part of a 4-vector, P11 = mr]^, (12.47) and it is natural to ask what the temporal component, 0 0 mc p = mri — y/l — u2/c 2 (12.48) represents. Einstein called m rel m yJ1 — U2 fc 2 (12.49) the relativistic mass (so that p° = mK\\c and p = mreiu; m itself was then called the rest mass), but modern usage has abandoned this terminology in favor of relativistic energy: E = 2 me y/1 ~ U2/C 2 (12.50) (so p° = E/c)h Because p° is (apart from the factor 1/c) the relativistic energy, pIL is called the energy-momentum 4-vector (or the momentum 4-vector, for short). Notice that the relativistic energy is nonzero even when the object is stationary, we call this rest energy: Erest = me2. (12.51) The remainder, which is attributable to the motion, we call kinetic energy Ekin = E - me2 = me2 ( ^ 1 - 1 ) . (12.52) \\ V 1 -u 2/c 2 J In the nonrelativistic regime (u « c) the square root can be expanded in powers of u2/c 2, giving ^ 1 7 3 mu4 Ekin = —mu 4- — ^—I-; (12.53) l o c the leading term reproduces the classical formula. So far, this is all just notation. The physics resides in the experimental fact that E and p, as defined by Eqs. 12.46 and 12.50, are conserved: In every closed9 system, the total relativistic energy and momentum are conserved. Since E and mr&] differ only by a constant factor (r-). there’s nothing to be gained by keeping both terms in circulation, and mK\\ has gone the way of the two dollar bill. If there are external forces at work, then (just as in the classical case) the energy and momentum of the system itself will not, in general, be conserved. 12.2. RELATIVISTIC MECHANICS 511 “Relativistic mass” (if you care to use that term) is also conserved—but this is equivalent to conservation of energy. Rest mass is not conserved—a fact that has been painfully familiar to everyone since 1945 (though the so-called “conversion of mass into energy” is really a conversion of rest energy into kinetic energy). Note the distinction between an invariant quantity (same value in all inertial systems) and a conserved quantity (same value before and after some process). Mass is invariant, but not conserved; energy is conserved but not invariant; electric charge (as we shall see) is both conserved and invariant; velocity is neither conserved nor invariant. The scalar product of plL with itself is P^Pii. = ~(P°)2 + (P   P) = ~m 2c 2, (12.54) as you can quickly check using the result of Prob. 12.26. In terms of the relativistic energy, 2 2 pc m2c 4. (12.55) This result is extremely useful, for it enables you to calculate E (if you know p), or p (knowing E), without ever having to determine the velocity. Problem 12.28 (a) Repeat Prob. 12.2 using the (incorrect) definition p = mu, but with the (correct) Einstein velocity addition mle. Notice that if momentum (so defined) is conserved in S, it is not conserved in S. Assume all motion is along the x axis. (b) Now do the same using the correct definition, p = mi}. Notice that if momentum (so defined) is conserved in S it is automatically also conserved in S. [Hint: Use Eq. 12.43 to transform the proper velocity.] What must you assume about relativistic energy? Problem 12.29 If a particle’s kinetic energy is n times its rest energy, what is its speed? Problem 12.30 Suppose you have a collection of particles, all moving in the x direction, with energies E\\, E 2, £ 3, ...and momenta p\\. pj, P3,_ Find the velocity of the center of momentum frame, in which the total momentum is zero. 12.2.3 Relativistic Kinematics In this section we’ll explore some applications of the conservation laws to particle decays and collisions. Example 12.7 Two lumps of clay, each of (rest) mass m, collide head-on at |c (Fig. 12.26). They stick together. Question: what is the mass (M) of the composite lump? 512 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY m m M (before) (after) Figure 12.26 Solution: In this case conservation of momentum is trivial: zero before, zero after. The energy of each lump prior to the collision is Vl - 0/5) 2 5 2 4mc , and the energy of the composite lump after the collision is Me2 (since it’s at rest). So conser¬ vation of energy says ^ 9 S 9 9 %mc + me = Me , and hence M = |m. Notice that this is greater than the sum of the initial masses! Mass was not conserved in this collision; kinetic energy was converted into rest energy, so the mass increased. In the classical analysis of such a collision, we say that kinetic energy was converted into thermal energy—the composite lump is hotter than the two colliding pieces. This is, of course, true in the relativistic picture too. But what is thermal energy? It’s the sum total of the random kinetic and potential energies of all the atoms and molecules in the substance. Relativity tells us that these microscopic energies are represented in the mass of the object: a hot potato is heavier than a cold potato, and a compressed spring is heavier than a relaxed spring. Not by much, it’s true—internal energy (U) contributes an amount U/c 2 to the mass, and c2 is a very large number by everyday standards. You could never get two lumps of clay going anywhere near fast enough to detect the nonconservation of mass in their collision. But in the realm of elementary particles, the effect can be very striking. For example, when the neutral pi meson (mass 2.4 x 10-28 kg) decays into an electron and a positron (each of mass 9.11 x 10-31 kg), the rest energy is converted almost entirely into kinetic energy—less than 1% of the original mass remains. In classical mechanics there’s no such thing as a massless particle—its kinetic energy (5m u 2) and its momentum (mu) would be zero, you couldn’t apply a force to it (F = ma), and hence (by Newton’s third law) it couldn’t apply a force on anything else—it’s a cipher, as far as physics is concerned. You might at first assume that the same is true in relativity: after all, p and E are still proportional to m. However, a closer inspection of Eqs. 12.46 and 12.50 reveals a loophole worthy of a congressman: If u = c, then the zero in the numerator is balanced by a zero in the denominator, leaving p and E indeterminate (zero over zero). It is conceivable, therefore, that a massless particle could carry energy and momentum. 12.2. RELATIVISTIC MECHANICS 513 provided it always travels at the speed of light. Although Eqs. 12.46 and 12.50 would no longer suffice to determine E and p, Eq. 12.55 suggests that the two should be related by E — pc. (12.56) Personally, I would regard this argument as a joke, were it not for the fact that at least one massless particle is known to exist in nature: the photon.10 Photons do travel at the speed of light, and they obey Eq. 12.56.'1 They force us to take the “loophole” seriously. (By the way, you might ask what distinguishes a photon with a lot of energy from one with very little—after all, they have the same mass (zero) and the same speed (c). Relativity offers no answer to this question; curiously, quantum mechanics does: According to the Planck formula, E = hv, where h is Planck’s constant and v is the frequency. A blue photon is more energetic than a red one!) Example 12.8 A pion at rest decays into a muon and a neutrino (Fig. 12.27). Find the energy of the outgoing muon, in terms of the two masses, mn and m^ (assume mv = 0). •n P (before) (after) Figure 12.27 Solution: In this case ^before = Pbefore = 0- Rafter = + E v, Pafter = P/U + Pu- Conservation of momentum requires that pv = —p^. Conservation of energy says that Ef.i + E v = nine . '^Until recently neutrinos were also generally assumed to be massless, but experiments in 1998 indicate that they may in fact carry a (very small) mass. 11 The photon is the quantum of the electromagnetic field, and it is no accident that the same ratio between energy and momentum holds for electromagnetic waves (see Eqs. 9.60 and 9.62). 514 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Now, E v - |pv|e, by Eq. 12.56, whereas |pM| = E 2 p _ m 2 c4 / c> by Eq 12.5 5> so from which it follows that En = (m l + '\" m)6'2 ImTr In a classical collision, momentum and mass are always conserved, whereas kinetic energy, in general, is not. A “sticky” collision generates heat at the expense of kinetic energy; an “explosive” collision generates kinetic energy at the expense of chemical energy (or some other kind). If the kinetic energy is conserved, as in the ideal collision of the two billiard balls, we call the process elastic. In the relativistic case, momentum and total energy are always conserved but mass and kinetic energy, in general, are not. Once again, we call the process elastic if kinetic energy is conserved. In such a case the rest energy (being the total minus the kinetic) is also conserved, and therefore so too is the mass. In practice this means that the same particles come out as went in. Examples 12.7 and 12.8 were inelastic processes; the next one is elastic. Example 12.9 Compton scattering. A photon of energy Eq “bounces” off an electron, initially at rest.

If they stick together, what is the mass of the resulting composite particle? What is its velocity? Problem 12.33 A neutral pion of (rest) mass m and (relativistic) momentum p = ^mc decays into two photons. One of the photons is emitted in the same direction as the original pion, and the other in the opposite direction. Find the (relativistic) energy of each photon. Problem 12.34 In the past, most experiments in particle physics involved stationary targets: one particle (usually a proton or an electron) was accelerated to a high energy E, and collided with a target particle at rest (Fig. 12.29a). Far higher relative energies are obtainable (with the same accelerator) if you accelerate both particles to energy E, and fire them at each other (Fig. 12.29b). Classically, the energy E of one particle, relative to the other, is just 4E (why?)— not much of a gain (only a factor of 4). But relativistically the gain can be enormous. Assuming the two particles have the same mass, m, show that 9 F ^ E = — me2. (12.59) me1 O O Target o (a) (b) Figure 12.29 516 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Suppose you use protons (me2 = 1 GeV) with E = 30 GeV. What E do you get? What multiple of E does this amount to? (1 GeV=109 electron volts.) [Because of this relativistic enhancement, most modem elementary particle experiments involve colliding beams, instead of fixed targets.] Problem 12.35 In a pair annihilation experiment, an electron (mass m) with momentum Pe hits a positron (same mass, but opposite charge) at rest. They annihilate, producing two photons. (Why couldn’t they produce just one photon?) If one of the photons emerges at 60° to the incident electron direction, what is its energy? 12.2.4 Relativistic Dynamics Newtonlaw is built into the principle of relativity. His second law, in the form (12.60) retains its validity in relativistic mechanics, provided we use the relativistic momentum. Example 12.10 Motion under a constant force. A particle of mass m is subject to a constant force F If it starts from rest at the origin, at time t = 0, find its position (x), as a function of time. Solution: dp = F =>  p = Ft + constant, but since p = 0 at t = 0, the constant must be zero, and hence P = mu V1 — u2/c 2 = Ft. Solving for u, we obtain _ (F/m)t x/1 + (Ft/me)2 The numerator, of course, is the classical answer—it’s approximately right, if But the relativistic denominator ensures that u never exceeds c; in fact, as t ->• To complete the problem we must integrate again: (12.61) (F/m)t < c. oo, u —>- c. x(t) F t' m Jo y/l + (Ft'/me)2 2 me ~~F 1 + (Ft’/me)2 2 me ~F (12.62) n place of the classical parabola, x(t) = (F/2m)t2, the graph is a hyperbola (Fig. 12.30)- for this reason, motion under a constant force is often called hyperbolic motion. It occurs,’ for example, when a charged particle is placed in a uniform electric field. 12.2. RELATIVISTIC MECHANICS 517 Figure 12.30 Work, as always, is the line integral of the force: W = IFdl (12.63) The work-energy theorem (“the net work done on a particle equals the increase in its kinetic energy”) holds relativistically: while ....... f dp — . — dt = / — • u dt, J dt dp dl dt dt dp dt mu u — dt y y/\\ — w2/c 2 mu du d me (1 - w2/c 2) 3/ 2 dt dt \\yi - u2/c 21 dE dt = —, (12.64) SO /d E -frdt = Ffinal - initial. (12.65) (Since the rest energy is constant, it doesn’t matter whether we use the total energy, here, or the kinetic energy.) Unlike to the first two, Newton’s third law does not, in general, extend to the relativistic domain. Indeed, if the two objects in question are separated in space, the third law is incompatible with the relativity of simultaneity. For suppose the force of A on B at some instant t is F(t), and the force of B on A at the same instant is —F(t); then the third law applies, in this reference frame. But a moving observer will report that these equal 518 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY and opposite forces occurred at different times; in his system, therefore, the third law is violated. Only in the case of contact interactions, where the two forces are applied at the same physical point (and in the trivial case where the forces are constant), can the third law be retained. Because F is the derivative of momentum with respect to ordinary time, it shares the ugly behavior of (ordinary) velocity, when you go from one inertial system to another: both the numerator and the denominator must be transformed. Thus,12 F v = dpy dt dp y dp},/dt F v YP , y dt- d x c P dx \\ c dt / y( i - P ux/ c)’ (12 .66) and similarly for the z component: F- The x component is even worse: F z y(l - Pux/ c)' F x = dp x Ydpx-yfidp 0 dpx dt  P dt y dt - — dx c df_ dt F x - P (dE dt P dx c dt 1 - Puxj c We calculated dE/dt in Eq. 12.64; putting that in, F x - P(u • F)/c F x = , „ , (12.67) l-PUx/c Only in one special case are these equations reasonably tractable: If the particle is (instan¬ taneously) at rest in S, so that u = 0, then Fj. = —Fx, Y F\\\\ = h- (12.68) That is, the component of F parallel to the motion of S is unchanged, whereas components perpendicular are divided by y. It has perhaps occurred to you that we could avoid the bad transformation behavior of F by introducing a “proper” force, analogous to proper velocity, which would be the derivative of momentum with respect to proper time: dx (12.69) This is called the Minkowski force; it is plainly a 4-vector, since p 1' is a 4-vector and proper time is invariant. The spatial components of are related to the “ordinary” force by K = d p 1 dt ff 1 — iff /c 2 (12.70) 12Remember: y and p pertain to the motion of 5 with respect S —they are constants; u is the velocity of the particle with respect to S. 12.2. RELATIVISTIC MECHANICS 519 while the zeroth component, ^ 0 = djP_ =l _dE dr c dr ’ (12.71) is, apart from the 1 /c, the (proper) rate at which the energy of the particle increases—in other words, the (proper) power delivered to the particle. Relativistic dynamics can be formulated in terms of the ordinary force or in terms of the Minkowski force. The latter is generally much neater, but since in the long run we are interested in the particle’s trajectory as a function of ordinary time, the former is often more useful. When we wish to generalize some classical force law, such as Lorentz’s, to the relativistic domain, the question arises: Does the classical formula correspond to the ordinary force or to the Minkowski force? In other words, should we write F = ^(E + uxB), or should it rather be K=# + uxB)? Since proper time and ordinary time are identical in classical physics, there is no way at this stage to decide the issue. The Lorentz force law, as it turns out, is an ordinary force—later on I’ll explain why this is so, and show you how to construct the electromagnetic Minkowski force. Example 12.11 The typical trajectory of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field is cyclotron motion (Fig. 12.31). The magnetic force pointing toward the center, F = QuB, provides the centripetal acceleration necessary to sustain circular motion. Beware, however— in special relativity the centripetal force is not mu2/R, as in classical mechanics. Rather, as you can see from Fig. 12.32, dp = pdO, so Figure 12.31 Figure 12.32 520 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY (Classically, of course, p = mu, so F = mu2/R.) Thus, QuB = u PR ' or p = QBR. (12.72) In this form the relativistic cyclotron formula is identical to the nonrelativistic one, Eq. 5.3_the only difference is that p is now the relativistic momentum. Example 12.12 Hidden momentum. As a model for a magnetic dipole m, consider a rectangular loop of wire carrying a steady current. Picture the current as a stream of noninteracting positive charges that move freely within the wire. When a uniform electric field E is applied (Fig. 12.33), the charges accelerate in the left segment and decelerate in the right one.13 Find the total' momentum of all the charges in the loop. u+- º 1 o o o o •S o o t' „ / '1 o o V. o IpooooooooooJ  +-U. I Figure 12.33 Solution: The momenta of the left and right segments cancel, so we need only consider the top and the bottom. Say there are N + charges in the top segment, going at speed u+ to the right, and Al_ charges in the lower segment, going at (slower) speed w_ to the left. The current (/ — Xu) is the same in all four segments (or else charge would be piling up somewhere); in particular. / = QN+   M_f_ QN- so N±u± = II Q’ where Q is the charge of each particle, and l is the length of the rectangle. Classically, the momentum of a single particle is p = Mu (where M is its mass), and the total momentum (to the right) is /^classical — A7 /V_ u — MN—U n n = M- M — =0. Q Q ,3This is not a very realistic model for a current-carrying wire, obviously, but other models lead to exactly the same result. See V. Hnizdo, Am. J. Phys. 65, 92 (1997). 12.2. RELATIVISTIC MECHANICS 521 as one would certainly expect (after all, the loop as a whole is not moving). But relativistically p = yMu , and we get p = y+MN +u+ - y-MN-u- = —^~(y+ - j/_), which is not zero, because the particles in the upper segment are moving faster. In fact, the gain in energy (yMc2), as a particle goes up the left segment, is equal to the work done by the electric force, QEw , where w is the height of the rectangle, so QEw Y +~ y -- and hence IlEw But II w is the magnetic dipole moment of the loop; as vectors, m points into the page and p is to the right, so P = 1 r (m x E). Thus a magnetic dipole in an electric field carries linear momentum, even though it is not moving! This so-called hidden momentum is strictly relativistic, and purely mechanical; it precisely cancels the electromagnetic momentum stored in the fields (see Ex. 8.3; note that both results can be expressed in the form p = IIV /c 2). Problem 12.36 In classical mechanics Newton’s law can be written in the more familiar form F = ma. The relativistic equation, F = dp/dt, cannot be so simply expressed. Show, rather, that F = m 'J1 — u2 jc 2 where a = du/dt is the ordinary acceleration.

Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force law can be applied legitimately in any inertial system. Of course, what one observer interprets as an electrical process another may regard as magnetic, but the actual particle motions they predict will be identical. To the extent that this did not work out for Lorentz and others, who studied the question in the late nineteenth century, the fault lay with the nonrelativistic mechanics they used, not with the electrodynamics. Having corrected Newtonian mechanics, we are now in a position to develop a complete and consistent formulation of relativistic electrodynamics. But I emphasize that we will not be changing the rules of electrodynamics in the slightest— rather, we will be expressing these rules in a notation that exposes and illuminates their relativistic character. As we go along, I shall pause now and then to rederive, using the Lorentz transformations, results obtained earlier by more laborious means. But the main purpose of this section is to provide you with a deeper understanding of the structure of electrodynamics—laws that had seemed arbitrary and unrelated before take on a kind of coherence and inevitability when approached from the point of view of relativity. To begin with I’d like to show you why there had to be such a thing as magnetism, given electrostatics and relativity, and how, in particular, you can calculate the magnetic force between a current-carrying wire and a moving charge without ever invoking the laws of magnetism.14 Suppose you had a string of positive charges moving along to the right at speed v. I’ll assume the charges are close enough together so that we may regard them as a continuous line charge X. Superimposed on this positive string is a negative one, -X proceeding to the left at the same speed v. We have, then, a net current to the right, of magnitude I = 2Xv. (12.75) ,4This and several other arguments in this section are adapted from E. M. Purcell’s Electricity and Magnetism. 2d ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1985). 12.3. RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS 523 (b) Figure 12.34 Meanwhile, a distance s away there is a point charge q traveling to the right at speed u < v (Fig. 12.34a). Because the two line charges cancel, there is no electrical force on q in this system (5). However, let’s examine the same situation from the point of view of system S, which moves to the right with speed u (Fig. 12.34b). In this reference frame q is at rest. By the Einstein velocity addition rule, the velocities of the positive and negative lines are now v^fu 1 =F vu/c2 (12.76) Because V- is greater than t>+, the Lorentz contraction of the spacing between negative charges is more severe than that between positive charges; in this frame, therefore, the wire carries a net negative charge! In fact, where A± = ±(y ±)A0, (12.77) 1 Y± = (12.78) 524 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY and A(j is the charge density of the positive line in its own rest system. That’s not the same as A, of course—in S they’re already moving at speed v, so A = yX o, where y/l ~ V2/C 2 It takes some algebra to put y± into simple form: (12.79) (12.80) Y± = c 4 = uv y]\\ - jz(v =F «)2( 1 =F vu/c 2)~ 2 vVt uv)2 - c2( v t U)2 J(c2 c2 =p uv li uv/c2 - Y- V2)(c 2 — li2) y/\\ — U2 jc 2 (12.81) Evidently, then, the net line charge in S is —2 Xuv ^•tot = X+ + A_ = Ao(y+ — y~) = —  . ==• (12.82) clv 1 — u1 /c1 Conclusion: As a result of unequal Lorentz contraction of the positive and negative lines, a current-carrying wire that is electrically neutral in one inertial system will be charged in another. Now, a line charge Atot sets up an electric field E = -, Iticqs so there is an electrical force on q in S, to wit: F = qE = — Xv qu ttc0c2s yi - u2/c 2 (12.83) But if there’s a force on q in S, there must be one in S; in fact, we can calculate it by using the transformation rules for forces. Since q is at rest S, and F is perpendicular to u, the force in S is given by Eq. 12.68: F = J 1 — u2/c 2 F — (12.84) V 7T€QCZ S The charge is attracted toward the wire by a force that is purely electrical in S (where the wire is charged, and q is at rest), but distinctly nonelectrical in S (where the wire is neutral). Taken together, then, electrostatics and relativity imply the existence of another force. This 12.3. RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS 525 “other force” is, of course, magnetic. In fact, we can cast Eq. 12.84 into more familiar form by using c2 — (eo/ro)- 1 and expressing kv in terms of the current (Eq. 12.75): F = —qu IM)I 2ns (12.85) The term in parentheses is the magnetic field of a long, straight wire, and the force is precisely what we would have obtained by using the Lorentz force law in system S. 12.3.2 How the Fields Transform We have learned, in various special cases, that one observer’s electric field is another’s mag¬ netic field. It would be nice to know the general transformation rules for electromagnetic fields: Given the fields in S, what are the fields in SI Your first guess might be that E is the spatial part of one 4-vector and B the spatial part of another. If so, your intuition is wrong—it’s more complicated than that. Let me begin by making explicit an assumption that was already used implicitly in Sect. 12.3.1: Charge is invariant. Like mass, but unlike energy, the charge of a particle is a fixed number, independent of how fast it happens to be moving. We shall assume also that the transformation rules are the same no matter how the fields were produced—electric fields generated by changing magnetic fields transform the same way as those set up by stationary charges. Were this not the case we’d have to abandon the field formulation altogether, for it is the essence of a field theory that the fields at a given point tell you all there is to know, electromagnetically, about that point; you do not have to append extra information regarding their source. With this in mind, consider the simplest possible electric field: the uniform field in the region between the plates of a large parallel-plate capacitor (Fig. 12.35a). Say the capacitor is at rest in So and carries surface charges ±cto- Then „ rrn „ E0= — y. (12.86) eo But what if we examine this same capacitor from system S, moving to the right at speed no (Fig. 12.35b)? In this system the plates are moving to the left, but the field still takes the form E=— y; (12.87) eo the only difference is the value of the surface charge a. [Wait a minute! Is that the only difference? The formula E = cx/eo for a parallel plate capacitor came from Gauss’s law, and whereas Gauss’s law is perfectly valid for moving charges, this particular application also relies on symmetry. Are we sure that the field is still perpendicular to the plates? What if the field of a moving plane tilts, say, in the direction of motion, as in Fig. 12.35c? Well, even if it did (it doesn’t), the field between the plates, being the superposition of the +a field and the -a field, would nevertheless run perpendicular to the plates. For the -a field would aim as indicated in Fig. 12.35c (changing the sign of the charges reverses the direction of the field), and the vector sum kills off the parallel components.] 526 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY +o V -a v (C) Figure 12.35 Now, the total charge on each plate is invariant, and the width (w) is unchanged, but the length (/) is Lorentz-contracted by a factor ~ = 71 - vile1, (12.88) so the charge per unit area is increased by a factor y0: o = yo&o- (12.89) Accordingly, E1 = XoEo1 . (12.90) I have put in the superscript 1 to make it clear that this rule pertains to components of E that arc perpendicular to the direction of motion of S. To get the rule for parallel components, consider the capacitor lined up with the y z plane (Fig. 12.36). This time it is the plate separation (d) that is Lorentz-contracted, whereas / and w (and hence also a) are the same in both frames. Since the field does not depend on d, it follows that £ l[ = £ 0 • (12 .91) 12.3. RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS 527 d Figure 12.36 Example 12.13 Electric field of a point charge in uniform motion.

ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Figure 12.37 These are still expressed in terms of the So coordinates (x0, y0, ZQ) of the held point (P); I’d prefer to write them in terms of the S coordinates of P. From the Lorentz transformations (or, actually, the inverse transformations), *0 = Yo(x + vo0 = YoRx, V0 = >’ Ry, Z0 = z = Rz, where R is the vector from q to P (Fig. 12.37). Thus E = _*_ rogR_ 4*eo (y2R 2 cos2 9 + R2 sin2 <9)3/ 2 1 q{ 1 - Vq/c 2 ) r 4?t6o [1 — (Dq/c2) sin2 #]3/ 2 R2 (12.92) This, then, is the held of a charge in uniform motion; we got the same result in Chapter 10 using the retarded potentials (Eq. 10.68). The present derivation is far more efficient, and sheds some light on the remarkable fact that the held points away from the instantaneous (as opposed to the retarded) position of the charge: Ex gets a factor of yo from the Lorentz transformation of the coordinates; E y and Ez pick up theirs from the transformation of the field. It’s the balancing of these two j/q’s that leaves E parallel to R. But Eqs. 12.90 and 12.91 are not the most general transformation laws, for we began with a system <S0 in which the charges were at rest and where, consequently, there was no magnetic field. To derive the general rule we must start out in a system with both electric and magnetic fields. For this purpose S itself will serve nicely. In addition to the electric field Ey = —, (12.93) there is a magnetic field due to the surface currents (Fig. 12.35b): — TctuqX. (12.94) 12.3.

The fields in S are then = y(E y — vBz), (12 .102) Ez = —, By = ix0av 0. €0 (Use the right-hand rule to get the sign of By.) The rest of the argument is identical— everywhere we had Ey before, read Ez, and everywhere we had Bz, read —By\\ Ez = y(E z + vBy), By = y(B y + y-2E !). (12.103) As for the x components, we have already seen (by orienting the capacitor parallel to the yz plane) that Ex = Ex. (12 .10 4) 12.3. RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS 531 Since in this case there is no accompanying magnetic field, we cannot deduce the trans¬ formation rule for Bx. But another configuration will do the job: Imagine a long solenoid aligned parallel to the x axis (Fig. 12.40) and at rest in S. The magnetic field within the coil is Bx = Eo nl, (12.105) where n is the number of turns per unit length, and I is the current. In system S, the length contracts, so n increases: n — yn. (12.106) On the other hand, time dilates: The S clock, which rides along with the solenoid, runs slow, so the current (charge per unit time) in S is given by - 1 I = -/. (12.107) The two factors of y exactly cancel, and we conclude that Bx — Bx. Like E, the component of B parallel to the motion is unchanged. Let’s now collect together the complete set of transformation rules: Ex = Ex, Ey = y(E y - vBz), Bx = Bx, By = y ^By + Ez^j , Ez = Y(Ez + vBy), b z = y (b z - Ey) • (12.108) 532 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Two special cases warrant particular attention: 1. If B = 0 in S, then b = y^( E zy - Eyi) = ^(Ez9- f,*), or, since v = vx, ~ I I? - - , (v x E). cz (12.109) 2. If E = 0 in S, then E = -yv(B zy - Byz ) = -v(B z y- By z), or E = v x B. (12.110) In other words, if either E or B is zero (at a particular point) in one system, then in any other system the fields (at that point) are very simply related by Eq. 12.109 or Eq. 12.110. Example 12.14 Magnetic field of a point charge in uniform motion. Find the magnetic field of a point charge q moving at constant velocity v. Solution: In the particle’s rest frame (S0) the magnetic field is zero (everywhere), so in a system S moving to the right at speed v, B = -i(vxE). cz We calculated the electric field in Ex. 12.13.

Incidentally, in the nonrel- ativistic limit (v2 « c2), Eq. 12.111 reduces to Mo v x R which is exactly what you would get by naive application of the Biot-Savart law to a point charge (Eq. 5.40). 12.3.

[Be sure to define any auxiliary quantities you introduce, in terms of od, E 0, and the constants of nature.] (b) This same wave is observed from an inertial system S moving in the x direction with speed v relative to the original system S. Find the electric and magnetic fields in S, and express them in terms of the S coordinates: E(x, y, z, t) and B(x, y, 1, r). [Again, be sure to define any auxiliary quantities you introduce.] (c) What is the frequency d> of the wave in S7 Interpret this result. What is the wavelength X of the wave in S7 From a> and X, determine the speed of the waves in S. Is it what you expected? 12.3. RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS 535 (d) What is the ratio of the intensity in S to the intensity in <S? As a youth, Einstein wondered what an electromagnetic wave would look like if you could run along beside it at the speed of light. What can you tell him about the amplitude, frequency, and intensity of the wave, as v approaches c? 12.3.3 The Field Tensor As Eq. 12.108 indicates, E and B certainly do not transform like the spatial parts of the two 4-vectors—in fact, the components of E and B are stirred together when you go from one inertial system to another. What sort of an object is this, which has six components and transforms according to Eq. 12.108? Answer: It’s an antisymmetric, second-rank tensor. Remember that a 4-vector transforms by the rule = (12.112) (summation over v implied), where A is the Lorentz transformation matrix. If S is moving in the x direction at speed v, A has the form ( Y ~yP 0 0 > —yfi y 0 0 0 0 10 v 0 0 0 1 , (12.113) and Ay is the entry in row /i, column v. A (second-rank) tensor is an object with two indices, which transform with two factors of A (one for each index): P\" = A^A vat Xa. (12.114) A tensor (in 4 dimensions) has 4x4= 16 components, which we can display in a 4 x 4 array: .00 r01 r02 t03 .10 tn r12 f13 .20 /21 r22 r23 .30 r31 t32 t33 However, the 16 elements need not all be different. For instance, a symmetric tensor has the property t1'1' = tvii (symmetric tensor). (12.115) In this case there are 10 distinct components; 6 of the 16 are repeats (/0I = / l0. t02 = f20, r03 = t30, tn = r21, t13 — t31, t23 = t32). Similarly, an anrisymmetric tensor obeys tnv = t1'11 (antisymmetric tensor). (12.116) 536 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Such an object has just 6 distinct elements—of the original 16, six are repeats (the same ones as before, only this time with a minus sign) and four are zero (/°°. t11, t22, and F 3). Thus, the general antisymmetric tensor has the form 0 r01 t02 t03 -; 01 0 f12 F 3 - _ r 02 _,12 0 ,23 • • -F 3 -t 13 -F 3 0 Let’s see how the transformation rule 12.114 works, for the six distinct components of an antisymmetric tensor. Starting with F1, we have F1 = a°a> but according to Eq. 12.113, A° = 0 unless A. = 0 or 1, and = 0unless<r =0orl. So there are four terms in the sum: i01 = A0°A >F° + AqA[;01 + A® Aq?10 + A?A|f On the other hand, F° = t11 =0, while t01 = -r 10, so i01 = (A0°Al - A?Ai)r01 = (y2 - (Kye)V = ,01, I’ll let you work out the others—the complete set of transformation rules is t°i = f°i, i°2 = y(t02- f h]2), i03 - y(t03 + yffr31), F 3 = F 3, F 1 = y(t31 + fit03), t'2 = y(tn - pt02). (12.117) These are precisely the rules we derived on physical grounds for the electromagnetic fields (Eq. 12.108)—in fact, we can construct the field tensor T1111 by direct comparison:15 Thus relativity completes and perfects the job begun by Oersted, combining the electric and magnetic fields into a single entity, T1111. If you followed that argument with exquisite care, you may have noticed that there was a different way of imbedding E and B in an antisymmetric tensor: instead of comparing Some authors prefer the convention A*' = Ex. A 3 = cBz. and so on, and some use the opposite signs. Accordingly, most of the equations from here on will look a little different, depending on the text. 12.3. RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS 537 the first line of Eq. 12.108 with the first line of Eq. 12.117, and the second with the second, we could relate the first line of Eq. 12.108 to the second line of Eq. 12.117, and vice versa. This leads to dual tensor, G1'11: 0 Bx By Bz -B x 0 — EzJc Ey/C Sy E-Jc 0 ~E x/ c -B z ~Ey/C Ex/ c 0 (12.119) Gl> 11 can be obtained directly from E1111 by the substitution E/c —º B, B —º —E/c. Notice that this operation leaves Eq. 12.108 unchanged—that’s why both tensors generate the correct transformation rules for E and B. Problem 12.48 Work out the remaining five parts to Eq. 12.117. Problem 12.49 Prove that the symmetry (or antisymmetry) of a tensor is preserved by Lorentz transformation (that is: if C v is symmetric, show that tlxv is also symmetric, and likewise for antisymmetric). Problem 12.50 Recall that a covariant 4-vector is obtained from a contravariant one by changing the sign of the zeroth component. The same goes for tensors: When you “lower an index” to make it covariant, you change the sign if that index is zero. Compute the tensor invariants F^F^, G^G^, and F^G^,, in terms of E and B. Compare Prob. 12.46. Problem 12.51 A straight wire along the z axis carries a charge density X traveling in the +z direction at speed v. Construct the field tensor and the dual tensor at the point (jc, 0, 0). 12.3.4 Electrodynamics in Tensor Notation Now that we know how to represent the fields in relativistic notation, it is time to reformulate the laws of electrodynamics (Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force law) in that lan¬ guage. To begin with, we must determine how the sources of the fields, p and J, transform. Imagine a cloud of charge drifting by; we concentrate on an infinitesimal volume V, which contains charge Q moving at velocity u (Fig. 12.43). The charge density is Q P = V and the current density16 is J = pu. l6I’m assuming all the charge in V is of one sign, and it all goes at the same speed. If not, you have to treat the constituents separately: J = p+U- + p_u_. But the argument is the same. 538 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY Figure 12.43 I would like to express these quantities in terms of the proper charge density p0, the density in the rest system of the charge: where Vo is the rest volume of the chunk. Because one dimension (the one along the direction of motion) is Lorentz-contracted, V = 1 - «2/c 2 Vq, (12.120) and hence P = PO y/\\ — U1 /c1 J — PO (12 .121) Comparing this with Eqs. 12.40 and 12.42, we recognize here the components of proper velocity, multiplied by the invariant po. Evidently charge density and current density go together to make a 4-vector: 7M = po?7M, whose components are = (CP,J x,J y,J z,) . We’ll call it the current density 4-vector. The continuity equation (Eq. 5.29), (12.122) (12.123) V J = - 9p 31 ’ expressing the local conservation of charge, takes on a nice compact form when written in terms of 7M. For V j _ d/x dJy 3 Jz _ y- 97' dx 3y 3z ^ dx* ’ i= 1 while dp 1 37° 37° 3t c dt dx° (12.124) 12.3. RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS 539 while dp 1 dJ° dJ° 3t c 3t dx° Thus, bringing dp/dt over to the left side, we have: 37M dxv = 0, (12.124) (12.125) with summation over /x implied. Incidentally, dJl‘-jdxl‘- is the four-dimensional divergence of J 11, so the continuity equation states that the current density 4-vector is divergenceless. As for Maxwell’s equations, they can be written 3 F^v dxv = dG^v dxv = 0, (12.126) with summation over v implied. Each of these stands for four equations—one for every value of pt. If p. = 0, the first equation reads 3 F0v dxv dF 00 3 F 01 3 F 02 3 F 03 dx° + dx1 + dx2 dx3 1 (dE x c \\ dx 3 Ey dy 9E z dz = i(V-E) c iM>J° = (XQCP, or V -E = —p. eo This, of course, is Gauss’s law. If pt — 1, we have dF lv dxv dF 10 dF ll dx° dx1 1 3 Ex 3 B + dF 12 dx2 3 B + dF 13 dx3 c2 3t dy = noJ1 = ixqJx- dz 1 3E = I-2\"a7”^ V x B cz dt Combining this with the corresponding results for p. = 2 and /x = 3 gives V x B = /xoJ + /roeo 3E ~d1’ which is Ampere’s law with Maxwell’s correction. 540 CHAPTER 12.

VxE = - 3B 37’ which is Faraday’s law. In relativistic notation, then, Maxwell’s four rather cumbersome equations reduce to two delightfully simple ones. In terms of Fliv and the proper velocity rf. the Minkowski force on a charge q is given by K^= q r ]vF ^. (12.127) For if /j, = 1, we have Kl = qrjvF lv = q(-r,0F i0 + rj1 Fn + q2 F]2 + r]3F 13) Lx/1 - u2/c 2 \\ c ) yi _ u2/c2 ( Bz)   \\! 1 — u2/c 2 (~By) [E + (u x B)].r, y/\\ ~ U2/C 2 with a similar formula for fi = 2 and /i = 3. Thus q K •y/l — U2/C 2 and therefore, referring back to Eq. 12.70, [E+(u xB)], (12.128) F = <?[E + (u x B)], which is the Lorentz force law. Equation 12.127, then, represents the Lorentz force law in relativistic notation. I’ll leave for you the interpretation of the zeroth component (Prob. 12.54). 12.3. RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS 541 Problem 12.52 Obtain the continuity equation (12.125) directly from Maxwell’s equations (12.126). Problem 12.53 Show that the second equation in (12.126) can be expressed in terms of the field tensor F^ v as follows: 9/V dF vX 8F^ dx^ dx^ dxv (12.129) Problem 12.54 Work out, and interpret physically, the ji = 0 component of the electromagnetic force law, Eq. 12.127. 12.3.5 Relativistic Potentials From Chapter 10 we know that the electric and magnetic fields can be expressed in terms of a scalar potential V and a vector potential A: E = —V V- , B = V x A. dt As you might guess, V and A together constitute a 4-vector: = (V/c,A x,A y,A z). In terms of this 4-vector potential the field tensor can be written (12.130) (12.131) dAv dA» dX^ 9.Xy (12.132) (Observe that the differentiation is with respect to the covariant vectors xlx and xv; remem¬ ber, that changes the sign of the zeroth component: xo = —x°. See Prob. 12.55.) To check that Eq. 12.132 is equivalent to Eq. 12.130, let’s evaluate a few terms explicitly. For ii = 0, v = 1, 9A 1 9A° _ dAx 1 dV dxo dxi d(ct) c dx 1 c 9A ~dt VV c That (and its companions with v = 2 and v = 3) is the first equation in 12.130. For /i = 1, v = 2, we get dx\\ 9A 1 9^2 dAy dx dAx dy = (V x A)z = Bz. 542 CHAPTER 12. ELECTRODYNAMICS AND RELATIVITY which (together with the corresponding results for F 13 and F23) is the second equation in 12.130. The potential formulation automatically takes care of the homogeneous Maxwell equa¬ tion (dGtlv/ dxv = 0). As for the inhomogeneous equation (dFtJ'v/dxv = (i07 M), that becomes _3_ _ 9 m dxM \\3x vy 3xv \\3x y/ (12.133) This is an intractable equation as it stands. However, you will recall that the potentials are not uniquely determined by the fields—in fact, it’s clear from Eq. 12.132 that you could add to A11 the gradient of any scalar function X: A* AM' = AM + —- dX dx,. (12.134) without changing F^v. This is precisely the gauge invariance we noted in Chapter 11; we can exploit it to simplify Eq. 12.133. In particular, the Lorentz gauge condition (Eq. 10.12) V • A = - 1 dV c2 31 becomes, in relativistic notation, 3AM IhG ~ °‘ In the Lorentz gauge, therefore, Eq. 12.133 reduces to ¡2A^ = -ix0J ^, (12.135) (12.136) where ¡2 is the d’Alembertian, ¡ 2 3 3 dxv dxv V2 1 92 c2 312 (12.137) Equation 12.136 combines our previous results into a single 4-vector equation—it represents the most elegant (and the simplest) formulation of Maxwell’s equations.17 17Incidentally, the Coulomb gauge is a bad one, from the point of view of relativity, because its defining condition, ^ 'A = 0, is destroyed by Lorentz transformation. To restore this condition, it is necessary to perform an appropriate gauge transformation every time you go to a new inertial system, in addition to the Lorentz transformation itself. In this sense is not a true 4-vector, in the Coulomb gauge. 12.3. RELATIVISTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS 543 Problem 12.55 You may have noticed that the four-dimensional gradient operator d/dx^ functions like a covariant 4-vector—in fact, it is often written dp, for short. For instance, the continuity equation, 3pj^ = 0, has the form of an invariant product of two vectors. The corresponding contra variant gradient would be 3^ = dxp. Prove that dfl( j> is a (contravariant) 4-vector, if <p is a scalar function, by working out its transformation law, using the chain rule. Problem 12.56 Show that the potential representation (Eq. 12.132) automatically satisfies dG^v/ dxv =0.

Examine the same configuration from the point of view of system S, moving in the x direction at speed v. In S the surface charge is at rest, so it generates no magnetic field.

Appendix A Vector Calculus in Curvilinear Coordinates A.l Introduction In this Appendix I sketch proofs of the three fundamental theorems of vector calculus. My aim is to convey the essence of the argument, not to track down every epsilon and delta. A much more elegant, modem, and unified—but necessarily also much longer—treatment will be found in M. Spivak’s book, Calculus on Manifolds (New York: Benjamin, 1965). For the sake of generality, I shall use arbitrary (orthogonal) curvilinear coordinates (u,v, w), developing formulas for the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian in any such system. You can then specialize them to Cartesian, spherical, or cylindrical coordinates, or any other system you might wish to use. If the generality bothers you on a first reading, and you’d rather stick to Cartesian coordinates, just read (x, y, z) wherever you see (u, v, w), and make the associated simplifications as you go along. A.2 Notation We identify a point in space by its three coordinates, u,v, and w, (in the Cartesian system, (x, y, z); in the spherical system, (r, 0, <p); in the cylindrical system, (s, f, z)). I shall assume the system is orthogonal, in the sense that the three unit vectors, u, v, and w, pointing in the direction of the increase of the corresponding coordinates, are mutually perpendicular. Note that the unit vectors are functions of position, since their directions (except in the Cartesian case) vary from point to point. Any vector can be expressed in terms of u, v, and w—in particular, the infinitesimal displacement vector from (u,v,w) to (u + du, v + dv, w + dw) can be written dl = f dua +g dv\\ + hdww, (A.l) 547 548 APPENDIX A. VECTOR CALCULUS IN CURVILINEAR COORDINATES where /, g, and h are functions of position characteristic of the particular coordinate system (in Cartesian coordinates f = g = h = 1; in spherical coordinates / = 1, g = r, h = r sin 0; and in cylindrical coordinates / = h = 1, g = s). As you’ll soon see, these three functions tell you everything you need to know about a coordinate system. A.3 Gradient If you move from point (u, v, w) to point (u + du,v + dv, w + dm), a scalar function t(u,v,w) changes by an amount , 9f dt , dt dt = ~-du+ —dv + — dw; (A.2) du dv dw ' this is a standard theorem on partial differentiation.1 We can write it as a dot product, dt = Vt -d\\ = (Vt)uf d u + (Vt)vg d v + (Vt)wh d w, (A.3) provided we define x 1 dt { )u = Jdu ’ (VOu The gradient of t, then, is 1 dt g dv’ (VOw 1 dt h dw 1 dt „ 1 dt „ 1 dt „ -u H-v H-w, f du g dv h dw (A.4) If you now pick the appropriate expressions for /, g, and h from Table A.l, you can easily generate the formulas for Vt in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, as they appear in the front cover of the book.

DIVERGENCE 549 b Figure A. 1 A.4 Divergence Suppose that we have a vector function, A(u, v,w) = Aua + Av\\ + Aw-w, and we wish to evaluate the integral <f A   da over the surface of the infinitesimal volume generated by starting at the point (u, v, w) and increasing each of the coordinates in succes¬ sion by an infinitesimal amount (Fig. A.2). Because the coordinates are orthogonal, this is (at least, in the infinitesimal limit) a rectangular solid, whose sides have lengths dlu = f du, dlv — g dv, and dlw = hdw, and whose volume is therefore dx = dlu dlv dlw = (fgh ) dudvdw. (A.6) (The sides are not just du, dv, dw —after all, v might be an angle, in which case d v doesn’t even have the dimensions of length. The correct expressions follow from Eq. A.l.) For the front surface, da = —(gh) dv dw u, so that A   da = —(ghA u) dv dw. The back surface is identical (except for the sign), only this time the quantity ghA u is to be evaluated at (u + du), instead of u.

A.7 becomes £ A • da = (V • A) dr. (A.9) Using Table A. 1, you can now derive the formulas for the divergence in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, which appear in the front cover of the book. As it stands, Eq. A.9 does not prove the divergence theorem, for it pertains only to infinitesimal volumes, and rather special infinitesimal volumes at that. Of course, a finite volume can be broken up into infinitesimal pieces, and Eq. A.9 can be applied to each one. The trouble is, when you then add up all the bits, the left-hand side is not just an integral over the outer surface, but over all those tiny internal surfaces as well. Luckily, however, these contributions cancel in pairs, for each internal surface occurs as the boundary of two adjacent infinitesimal volumes, and since (/a always points outward, A • da has the opposite sign for the two members of each pair (Fig. A.3). Only those surfaces that bound a single chunk—which is to say, only those at the outer boundary—survive when everything is added up. For finite regions, then. ^ A • da = j ( V   A) dr. (A. 10) and you need only integrate over the external surface.2 This establishes the divergence theorem. Figure A.3 2What about regions that cannot be fit perfectly by rectangular solids no matter how tiny they are—such as planes cut at an angle to the coordinate lines? It’s not hard to dispose of this case; try thinking it out for yourself, or look at H. M. Schey’s Div, Grad, Curl and All That (New York: W. W. Norton, 1973), starting with Prob. 11-15. 552 APPENDIX A. VECTOR CALCULUS IN CURVILINEAR COORDINATES A.5 Curl To obtain the curl in curvilinear coordinates, we calculate the line integral, j) A di, around the infinitesimal loop generated by starting at (u, v, w) and successively increasing u and v by infinitesimal amounts, holding w constant (Fig. A.4). The surface is a rectangle (at least, in the infinitesimal limit), of length dlu = f du, width dlv = gdv, and area da = (fg)dudvw. (A.ll) Assuming the coordinate system is right-handed, w points out of the page in Fig. A.4. Having chosen this as the positive direction for da, we are obliged by the right-hand rule to run the line integral counterclockwise, as shown. Along the bottom segment. dl = f du u, so A   dl — (f Au) du. Along the top leg, the sign is reversed, and f Au is evaluated at (v + dv) rather than v. Taken together, these two edges give ~(f Au)\\v+dv + (f A u)\\v du = — T(Mu) dv du dv. A.5. CURL 553 Similarly, the right and left sides yield OU du dv, so the total is f A • d\\ = 3 3 - — (JA U) du dv du dv 1 Tg d 3 ^(gA v) - —(/A u) du dv w • da. (A. 12) The coefficient of da on the right serves to define the w-component of the curl. Constructing the u and v components in the same way, we have 13) 14) Using Table A. 1, you can now derive the formulas for the curl in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates. Equation A. 14 does not by itself prove Stokes’ Theorem, however, because at this point it pertains only to very special infinitesimal surfaces. Again, we can chop any finite surface into infinitesimal pieces and apply Eq. A. 14 to each one (Fig. A.5). When we add them up, though, we obtain (on the left) not only a line integral around the outer boundary, but a lot of tiny line integrals around the internal loops as well. Fortunately, as before, the internal V x A = — gh |_3u d 3 -(hAw) — — (gA v) dw u H- fh 3 3 7 (/ Au) — —(hA w) dw du 1 fg 3 3 gAv) - -r-(fAu) du dv W, and Eq.

VECTOR CALCULUS IN CURVILINEAR COORDINATES contributions cancel in pairs, because every internal line is the edge of two adjacent loops running in opposite directions. Consequently, Eq. A. 14 can be extended to finite surfaces, A-d\\ = j ( V x A) • da, (A. 15) and the line integral is to be taken over the external boundary only.3 This establishes Stokes’ theorem. .6 Laplacian Since the Laplacian of a scalar is by definition the divergence of the gradient, we can read off from Eqs. A.4 and A.8 the general formula V2t = fgh L 9 du ** AA , A, 1 _(hnix f du) dv \\ g dv) dw \\ h dw)_ (A. 16) Once again, you are invited to use Table A. 1 to derive the Laplacian in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinates, and thus to confirm the formulas inside the front cover. 3What about surfaces that cannot be fit perfectly by tiny rectangles, no matter how small they are (such as triangles) or surfaces that do not correspond to holding one coordinate fixed? If such cases trouble you, and you cannot resolve them for yourself, look at H. M. Schey’s Div, Grad, Curl, and All That, Prob. III-2 (New York: W. W. Norton, 1973). Appendix B The Helmholtz Theorem Suppose we are told that the divergence of a vector function F(r) is a specified scalar function D(r): V F = D, (B.l) and the curl of F(r) is a specified vector function C(r): V x F = C. (B.2) For consistency, C must be divergenceless, V • C = 0, (B.3) because the divergence of a curl is always zero. Question: can we, on the basis of this information, determine the function F? If D(r) and C(r) go to zero sufficiently rapidly at infinity, the answer is yes, as I will show by explicit construction. I claim that F = —VC/ + V x W, (B.4) where and U{ r) = — --L I An J D(r') dr'. (B.5) W(r) = - 1- (B.6) An J i the integrals are over all of space, and, as always, 4 = |r — r'\\. For if F is given by Eq. B.4, then its divergence (using Eq. 1.102) is V • F = -W 2U = J D V2 ^ dr' = J D(r') <53(r - r') dr' = D(r). (Remember that the divergence of a curl is zero, so the W term drops out, and note that the differentiation is with respect to r, which is contained in 4.) 555 556 APPENDIX B. THE HELMHOLTZ THEOREM So the divergence is right; how about the curl? V x F = V x (V x W) =-V 2W +V(V • W). (B.7) (Since the curl of a gradient is zero, the U term drops out.) Now - V2W = J C V2 (^j dr' = j C(r')S3(r - r') dr' = C(r), which is perfect 111 be done if I can just persuade you that the second term on the right side of Eq. B.7 vanishes. Using integration by parts (Eq. 1.59), and noting that derivatives of >i with respect to primed coordinates differ by a sign from those with respect to unprimed coordinates, we have 4trV • W  / -/ ~/ C- V' c-vur f - V' • Cdz - d) - C • da. * J * dr' (B.8) But the divergence of C is zero, by assumption (Eq. B.3), and the surface integral (way out at infinity) will vanish, as long as C goes to zero sufficiently rapidly. Of course, that proof tacitly assumes that the integrals in Eqs. B.5 and B.6 converge— otherwise U and W don’t exist at all. At the large r' limit, where 4 % r', the integrals have the form /c c x(r') ~~r' 2d r'= l r'X(r')dr'. (B.9) (Here X stands for D or C, as the case may be). Obviously, Xir') must go to zero at large r'—but that’s not enough: if X ~ \\/r', the integrand is constant, so the integral blows up, and even if X ~ 1/r'2, the integral is a logarithm, which is still no good at r' -> oo. Evidently the divergence and curl of F must go to zero more rapidly than 1/r2 for the proof to hold. (Incidentally, this is more than enough to ensure that the surface integral in Eq. B.8 vanishes.) Now, assuming these conditions on D{r) and C(r) are met, is the solution in Eq. B.4 unique? The answer is clearly no, for we can add to F any vector function whose divergence and curl both vanish, and the result still has divergence D and curl C. However, it so happens that there is no function that has zero divergence and zero curl everywhere and goes to zero at infinity (see Sect. 3.1.5). So if we include a requirement that F(r) goes to zero as r oo, then solution B.4 is unique.1 'Typically we do expect the electric and magnetic fields to go to zero at large distances from the charges and currents that produce them, so this is not an unreasonable stipulation. Occasionally one encounters artificial problems in which the charge or current distribution itself extends to infinity—infinite wires, for instance, or infinite planes. In such cases other means must be found to establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to Maxwell’s equations. 557 Now that all the cards are on the table, I can state the Helmholtz theorem more rigor¬ ously: If the divergence D (r) and the curl C(r) of a vector function F(r) are specified, and if they both go to zero faster than 1 /r 2 as r oo, and if F(r) goes to zero as r —> oo, then F is given uniquely by Eq. B.4. The Helmholtz theorem has an interesting corollary: Any (differentiable) vector function F(r) that goes to zero faster than \\/r as r —> oo can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar plus the curl of a vector:2 For example, in electrostatics V • E = p/eo and V x E = 0, so E(r) = —V (—-— f dr'\\ = —VV, (B.ll) \\47reo J * ) where V is the scalar potential, while in magnetostatics V • B = 0 and V x B = /ioJ, so B(r) = V x ^ j dz'^j = V x A, (B.12) where A is the vector potential. 2As a matter of fact, any differentiable vector function whatever (regardless of its behavior at infinity) can be written as a gradient plus a curl, but this more general result does not follow directly from the Helmholtz theorem, nor does Eq. B.10 supply the explicit construction, since the integrals, in general, diverge. Appendix C Units In our units (the Systeme International) Coulomb’s law reads F = 1 qm 47T60 'll i (SI). (C.l) Mechanical quantities are measured in meters, kilograms, seconds, and charge is in coulombs (Table C.l). In the Gaussian system, the constant in front is, in effect, absorbed into the unit of charge, so that F = (Gaussian). (C.2) Mechanical quantities are measured in centimeters, grams, seconds, and charge is in elec¬ trostatic units (or esu). For what it’s worth, an esu is evidently a (dyne)'^-centimeter. Converting electrostatic equations from SI to Gaussian units is not difficult: just set eo 1 47T For example, the energy stored in an electric field (Eq. 2.45), U = j f E 2 dx (SI), becomes U — — j E 2 dr (Gaussian).

The Gaussian unit of magnetic field (the gauss) is the one quantity from this system in everyday use: people speak of volts, amperes, henries, and so on (all SI units), but for some reason they tend to measure magnetic fields in gauss (the Gaussian unit); the correct SI unit is the tesla (104 gauss). One major virtue of the Gaussian system is that electric and magnetic fields have the same dimensions (in principle, one could measure the electric fields in gauss too, though no one uses the term in this context).
